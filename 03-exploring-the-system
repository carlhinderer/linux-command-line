- Advanced use of ls

    # List files in long form
    $ ls -l

    # List files in long form, sorted by time
    $ ls -lt

    # Sorted by time, in reverse order
    ls -lt --reverse



- Options and arguments

   # Shell commands take the form
   $ command -options arguments

   # List all files with long form in reversed order
   $ ls -lt --reverse



-  ls -l Detail

     # -rw-r--r--          1st bit is for file or directory
                           2-4th bits are rwx for file's owner
                           5-7th bits are rwx for group members
                           8--10th bits are rwx for everyone else

    # 1                   The file's number of hard links

    # root                The username of the file's owner

    # root                The name of the group that owns the file

    # 1186219             The size of the file in bytes

- Important Linux Directories

    /               # The root directory

    /bin            # Binaries necessary for the system to boot and run
    
    /boot           # Contains the Linux kernel, the initial RAM image (with the drivers needed for booting),
                    #   and the boot loader

    /boot/vmlinuz         # The Linux kernel

    /boot/grub/menu.lst   # The boot loader configuration
    
    /dev            # Contains device nodes.  "Everything is a file" also applies to devices.  This is where
                    #   the kernel maintains a list of all the devices it understands.
    
    /etc            # Contains all the system-wide configuration files.  Also contains the shell scripts that
                    #   start all the system services at boot time.  

    /etc/crontab    # Defines when automated jobs will run

    /etc/fstab      # Table of storage devices and their associated mount points.

    /ect/passwd     # A list of the user accounts
    
    /home           # Each user is given a home directory.  Normal users can only write to files in their
                    #   home directory.
    
    /lib            # Contains shared library files used by the core system programs.
    
    /lost+found     # Used in case of a file system corruption event.  Will normally be empty.
    
    /media          # On modern systems, this contains the mount points for removable media, such
                    #   as USB drives and CR-ROMS, that are mounted automatically.
    
    /mnt            # On older systems, this contains the mount points that were mounted manually.
    
    /opt            # Used to install optional software, like commercial products you may install.
    
    /proc           # Virtual file system maintained by the Linux kernel.  The 'files' it contains are 
                    #   peepholes into the kernel itself.
    
    /root           # This is the home directory for the root account.
    
    /sbin           # Contains system binaries.  These are vital system tasks reserved for the superuser.
    
    /tmp            # Used for storing temporary, transient files created by various programs.
    
    /usr            # Contains all the programs and support files used by regular users.

    /usr/bin        # Contains the executable programs installed by your Linux distribution.

    /usr/lib        # The shared libraries for programs in usr/bin

    /usr/local      # Programs not included with your distro, but are intended for system-wide use.  Will
                    #   be empty on a newly installed system.

    /usr/sbin       # Contains more system administration programs.

    /usr/share      # Contains all the shared data used by programs in /usr/bin.  These are things like
                    #   default config files, icons, screen backgrounds, sound files, etc.

    /usr/share/doc  # Documentation for packages installed on system.
    
    /var            # This is where data that is likely to change is stored, like databases, spool files, 
                        and user mail is stored.

    /var/log        # Log files



- Determining a File's Type with 'file'

    # Get the type of a file
    $ file filename

    # JPEG type
    $ file picture.jpg

    picture.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01



- Viewing File Contents with 'less'

    The 'less' program is used to view text files (one-to-one mappings of characters to integers).

    # View file
    $ less /etc/passwd


    less Commands

    Command             Action
    -------------------------------------
    Page Up or b        Scroll back one page
    Page Down or space  Scroll forward one page
    Up arrow            Scroll up one line
    Down arrow          Scroll down one line

    q                   Quit less



- Symbolic Links

    When we see something like this in a directory:

    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 2007-08-11 07:34 libc.so.6 -> libc-2.6.so

    The 'l' at the beginning means it is a symbolic link (aka a 'soft link' or 'sym link'). They allow
      us to do things like update a library without having to find everywhere the library is
      used and update them all.  We can just create a sym link to the new library.

    For instance, it's a good idea to have a file name 'foo-2.6' when we are using version 2.6.  When
      we install 'foo-2.7', we won't want to update every place that refers to 'foo', so we just 
      create a sym link 'foo' that points to 'foo-2.6'.
