CHAPTER 6 - REDIRECTION
-------------------------------------------------

- Standard Input, Output, and Error

    - Many of the programs we have used so far produce output of some kind.  The output often consists
        of 2 types:

        1. The program's results
        2. Status and error messages


    - If we look at a command like 'ls', we can see it displays its results and error messages to the 
        screen.  Keeping with the Unix theme of 'everything is a file', ls actually sends its results
        to a special file called 'standard output (stdout)' and its status messages to another file
        called 'standard error (stderr)'.  By default, both standard output and standard error are
        linked to the screen and not saved in a disk file.


    - In addition, many programs take input from a facility called 'standard input (stdin)', which is
        attached to the keyboard by default.


    - IO Redirection allows us to change where output goes and where input comes from.  Normally, output
        goes to the screen and input comes from the keyboard, but with IO redirection we can change that.



- Redirecting Standard Output

    - To redirect standard output to another file instead of the screen, we use the '>' redirection
        operator.  

      # Redirect stdout to a file
      $ ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt


    - Now, we'll try running the command on a directory that doesn't exist:

      # /bin/usr doesn't exist
      $ ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt

      Here, we'll see that an error is printed to the screen, and out 'ls-output.txt' file now has
        zero length.  This is because the '>' operator always rewrites the destination file from the
        beginning.  


    - We can even truncate a file or create a new empty file with the '>' operator.

      # Truncate a file
      $ > ls-output.txt


    - If we want to append to an existing file instead of overwriting it, the '>>' redirection operator
        is used.

      # Append to the file instead
      $ ls -l /usr/bin >> ls-output.txt



- Redirecting Standard Error

    - Redirecting stderr lacks the ease of a dedicated redirection operator.  To redirect stderr, we
        must refer to its 'file descriptor'.  

      A program can produce output on any of several numbered file streams.  The shell references the
        stdin, stdout, and stderr streams internally as file descriptors, 0, 1, and 2. 


      # Redirect stderr from this command
      $ ls -l /bin/usr 2> ls-error.txt



- Redirecting stdout and stderr to One File

    - We can capture all of the output of a command to a single file.  To do this, we must redirect
        stdout and stderr at the same time.  There are 2 ways to do this:


      # First way (traditional)
      $ ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt 2>&1


      # Second way (in more recent versions of bash)
      $ ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt


      # Second way, with appending instead of overwriting
      $ ls -l /bin/usr &>> ls-output.txt



- Disposing of Unwanted Output

    - Sometimes, we just want to throw the output from a command away.  This applies particularly
        to error and status messages.  We can do this by redirecting to a special file called '/dev/null'.
        This file is often referred to as a 'bit bucket', which accepts input and does nothing with
        it.  


      # Suppress error messages from a command
      $ ls -l /bin/usr 2> /dev/null



- Redirecting stdin using 'cat'

    - To demonstrate this, we introduce our first command that uses stdin.  The 'cat' command reads one
        or more files and copies them to stdout.


      # Print file to stdout
      $ cat ls-output.txt


    - Since 'cat' can accept more than one file as an argument, it can be used to join (concatenate)
        files together.  

      For instance, say we download a movie file that has been split into pieces, and we want to join
        them back together.  If the files are named 'movie.mpeg.001' to 'movie.mpeg.099', we could 
        join them together with:


      # Join movie file back together
      $ cat movie.mpeg.0* > movie.mpeg


      Since wildcards always expand in sorted order, the arguments will be arranged in the correct 
        order.


    - Now, we can enter cat with no arguments:


      # No arguments
      $ cat


      It appears to just hang, but that's what it's supposed to do.  It's waiting for stdin, which is
        attached to the keyboard by default.  Anything we type will be echoed to the screen.


    - Now that we know that cat accepts standard input and filenames, we can redirect stdin:


      # Change stdin to 'lazy_dog.txt'
      $ cat < lazy_dog.txt


      We can see that this is the same as passing a single filename argument.



- Pipelines

    - The capability of commands to read data from stdin and send to stdout is utilized by a shell 
        feature called 'pipelines'.  Using the pipe operator '|', the stdout of one command can
        be piped into the stdin of another command.


      # Pipe one command's output to another's input
      $ command1 | command2

      # Example
      $ ls -l /usr/bin | less



- Filters

    - Pipelines are often used to perform complex operations on data.  Frequently, commands used this
        way are referred to as 'filters'.

      $ command1 | command2



- The 'sort' Command

      # The 'sort' command will take the listing from both directories and sort into a single list
      $ ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | less



- The 'uniq' Command

      # The 'uniq' command accepts a sorted list and removes any duplicates from the list
      $ ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | less


      # If we want to see the list of duplicates instead of removing them, use 'uniq -d'
      $ ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq -d | less



- The 'wc' Command

      # The 'wc' command displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in files
      $ wc ls-output.txt


      # The 'wc -l' command counts lines instead of words
      $ ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | wc -l



- The 'grep' Command

      # The 'grep' command is used to find text patterns within files
      $ grep pattern [file...]

      # Get the items from our list that contain the string 'zip'
      $ ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | grep zip


      grep options
      ----------------
      -i      Ignore Case
      -v      Only print lines that don't match the pattern



- The 'head' and 'tail' Commands

      # Display the first 5 lines of a file
      $ head -n 5 ls-output.txt


      # Display the last 5 lines of a file
      $ tail -n 5 ls-output.txt


    The 'tail' command has an option that allows us to view files in real time.  This is useful for
      watching the progress of log files as they are being written.  

      # View file in real time
      $ tail -f /var/log/messages



- The 'tee' Command

    In keeping with the plumbing metaphors, Linux provides a command called 'tee' which creates a tee
      fitting on our pipe.  The 'tee' program reads stdin and copies it to both stdout (allowing data
      to continue down the pipeline) and to one or more files.  This is useful for capturing a pipeline's
      contents at an intermediate stage of processing.


      # Save to file before running grep
      $ ls /usr/bin | tee ls.txt | grep zip
