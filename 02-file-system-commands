CHAPTER 2 - FILE SYSTEM COMMANDS
-------------------------------------------------

- In Windows, each storage device has its own file system tree.  In Linux, there is a 
    single tree, and separate storage devices can be mounted at any point in it.



- File System Commands

    # Print current working directory
    $ pwd

    # Change working directory
    cd

    # List contents of working directory
    ls



- Absolute vs Relative Pathnames

    # Absolute pathnames are defined from the root of the file tree
    $ cd /usr/bin

    # Relative pathnames are defined from the current working directory
    . refers to current directory
    .. refers to parent directory

    # ./ is implicit
    $ cd bin



- cd Shortcuts

    # Changes to your home directory
    $ cd

    # Changes to previous directory
    $ cd -  

    # Changes to home directory of different user
    $ cd ~username



- Filename Details

    - Filenames that begin with . are hidden.  Use 'ls -a' to list them.

    - Linux has no concept of file extensions.  Many applications do, however.

    -  Only use periods, dashes, and underscores in filenames. Other special characters cause problems.
