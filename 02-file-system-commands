# In Windows, each storage device has its own file system tree
# In Linux, there is a single tree, and separate storage devices can be mounted at any point in it.

# /usr/bin = Place where most programs are installed

# Absolute pathnames are defined from the root of the file tree

# Relative pathnames are defined from the current working directory
    . refers to current directory
    .. refers to parent directory

# cd Shortcuts
cd    # Changes to your home directory
cd -  # Changes to previous directory
cd ~username    # Changes to home directory of different user

# Filenames that begin with . are hidden

# Linux has no concept of file extensions.  Many applications do, however.

# Only use periods, dashes, and underscores in filenames. Other special characters cause problems.
