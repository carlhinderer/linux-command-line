CHAPTER 7 - WEB SERVERS
-------------------------------------------------------

- Building a LAMP Server

    - The LAMP server is such a common Linux configuration that Ubuntu has its own 
        installation media package.

        # The ^ indicates a special bundled package
        $ sudo apt install lamp-server


    - For this exercise, we'll install each piece separately instead.  These are the steps we
        will follow:

        1. Install Apache
        2. Add a web page to the web document root
        3. Install a SQL engine (MariaDB)
        4. Install PHP
        5. Install and configure MediaWiki



- Setting Up an Apache Server

    - Apache tends to dominate the HTTP server market, although Nginx and IIS also have
        a lot of market share.


    - To start, we just install the server, and it should already be running after install.

        $ sudo apt install apache2

      To navigate to the default page, just go to 'localhost' in your web browser.


    - Now, we'll add some content to our web site.  Apache will direct all incoming requests
        to a location specified in an Apache configuration file.  In Ubuntu, this file is
        located at '/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf'.

        # Contents of 000-default.conf
        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
            DocumentRoot /var/www/html
            ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
            CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
        </VirtualHost>

       The 'DocumentRoot' attribute shows that the root document is located in '/var/www/html'.
         It is called 'index.html'.


    - We'll overwrite the Apache default file with our own file.

        And how about a look at our new company logo: <img src="logo.png" />
