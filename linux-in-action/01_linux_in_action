    /etc/apt/sources.list
      = list of apt sources that packages may be installed from

    /etc/crontab
      = 'cron' configuration file

    /etc/fstab
      = config file for 'mount'

    /etc/group
      = list of user groups and who belongs to them

    /etc/hostname
      = contains hostname of your machine

    /etc/host.conf
      = determines the search order of DNS lookups

    /etc/hosts
      = Used to define a name for each domain/ip address

    /etc/hosts.allow
      = Used to control access to your machine's services

    /etc/hosts.deny
      = Used to specify hosts not allowed to access the system

    /etc/httpd

    /etc/modules

- File Globbing

    The term 'globbing' is derived from the word 'global'.  It describes applying wildcard
      characters to filenames in commands.


      # Move all files to another directory
      $ mv * /some/other/directory/

      # Move files matching a particular sequence
      $ mv file* /some/other/directory/

      # Match a single character
      $ mv file? /some/other/directory/



- Pseudo files and devices

    A Linux pseudo (or virtual) file is dynamically generated by the OS at runtime.  These are
      often placed in the '/sys/' or '/proc/' directories.

    A 'loop device' is a pseudo device that allows a file to be used as though it's an actual
      physical device.



- Searching the system logs

    The 'journalctl' command is used to access the system logs.


      # Look at all the system logs
      $ sudo journalctl

      # Search for a specific filename
      $ sudo journalctl | grep filename.php

      # Find the lines with 'error' in the file
      $ sudo journalctl | grep filename.php | grep error

      # File the lines without 'error' (-v for inverted)
      $ sudo journalctl | grep filename.php | grep -v error
