- Key Concepts in Building Reliable Systems

    - The only solution to the chaos of startups is automation, skepticism, humility, and immutable
        DevOps principles.

    - Human beings cannot be involved in deploying software in the long term.  Deploying, testing, and
        building software needs to be 100% automated.

    - The most significant initial impact you can have in a company is to set up continuous integration
        and continuous delivery.



- Immutable DevOps Principles

    - Centralized Logging

        - Logging follows closely behind automation in importance.  In large-scale, distributed systems,
            logging is not optional.  

        - For instance, exceptions should always be sent to the centralized logging system.  On the 
            other hand, it is a good idea to create debug-level logging while creating new features.
            The solution is to use logging levels so that
