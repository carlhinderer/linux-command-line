CHAPTER 2 - FILE MANAGERS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- The Default File Manager

    - The 'Thunar' graphical file manager is the default manager for the Xfce desktop.


- Text-Mode File Managers

    - Midnight Commander

        - 'Midnight Commander' is a text-based program used to interact with local and remote
            Linux computers using the CLI.  It can be used with any of the common shells or SSH.
            It can be used to copy, edit, move, or delete files and directories.

        - To use Midnight Commander:

            # Install midnight commander
            $ dnf -y install mc

            # Start midnight commander
            $ mc

            # Get help
            $ man mc


    - VIFM

        - Vifm is a dual-pane file manager that provides a Vim-like environment.  All the normal
            vim commands work, so it's great for vim people.


    - nnn

        - The 'nnn' file manager is a simple, single-pane tool with no frills.  Only one
            directory and its content is displayed at a time.  



- Graphical File Managers

    - Krusader

        - Krusader is a graphical file manager modeled after Midnight Commander.  It uses the
            same commands and layout.


    - Thunar

        - Thunar is the default file manager for the Xfce desktop.  


    - Dolphin

        - Dolphin is simple in a similar way to Krusader, but requires a lot more dependencies.


    - XFE

        - XFE is more flexible and fully-featured than Thunar or Dolphin.
