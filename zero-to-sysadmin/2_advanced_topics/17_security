- Basic Steps to Harden a System

    1. Limit physical access to prevent unauthorized people from inserting malware via a USB drive.

    2. Use strong passwords and enforce this rule.

    3. Change passwords frequently.  Password aging can be used to enforce this.

    4. Do not share user accounts.  If multiple users need a shared document, create a group.

    5. Delete old user accounts when they are no longer needed.

    6. Strong firewalls are an important part of any security regimen.

    7. Use public/private key pairs with SSH.

    8. Do not store sensitive data on computers that are firewalls or routers that are directly
         accessible to the internet.

    9. In larger organizations data should not be stored on any host in the DMZ.

    10. Intrusion detection can be used to detect when an intrusion has occurred.

    11. Verify open ports with tools like nmap.  There should be no unexpected or unnecessary open ports.

    12. Use a BIOS password to prevent changes during the hardware boot sequence.

    13. Use a GRUB password to prevent changes to Linux initialization and startup.

    14. Turn off or remove unused services to prevent attacks against any possible vulnerabilities.

    15. Use firewalls to limit inbound and outbound traffic to be only what would be expected on a given
          host.

    16. Use SELinux to prevent hackers from making changes even if they do gain access to a host.

    17. Use intrusion detection software like Tripwire to report altered files and other signs of a
          successful or attempted intrusion.

    18. Disable ZEROCONF, which is a network self-configuration program when static configuration has 
          not been performed and DHCP is not available.  This service is sometimes known as 'avahi'.

    19. Sync all system times using NTP to make it easier to compare log files.

    20. Only allow root to run cron jobs.

    21. Enable only the ssh2 protocol, which is the default in Red Hat-based distros like Fedora.

    22. Do now allow root logins, especially remote ones.  Log in as a non-user and then su to root.

    23. Real SysAdmins don't use sudo.  

    24. If a non-root user really does need access to a command that requires root privilege, configure
          sudo for that one user to use that one command.

    25. Back up everything - frequently.
