- About Printers

    - Printers build up an image of a page to be printed one line at a time.  Each line is as
        wide as the vertical size of the print head.  


    - Old dot matrix printers printed one line of text at a time.  Modern printers print images, 
        even if the image is only text.  Ink jet printers print the image one line at a time
        directly onto the paper.  Laser printers generate an entire image onto a drum inside the
        printer, then transfer the entire image onto the page at one time.



- Print Languages

    - To create images to be printed, software must generate a data stream that can be 
        interpreted and converted to an image for printing.  The data streams are created using
        one of the common PDLs (page description language).

      These PDLs describe the the appearance of the page when it is printed.  They use commands
        like 'Draw a box at this location with this width and height' or 'Center some text using
        this font'.


    - There are many PDLs, but there are only 3 in common use by today's printers:

        1. PCL
             HP's Printer Control Language

        2. Postscript
             Adobe Systems' first PDL

        3. PDF
             Adobe Systems' Portable Document Format



- Printers and Linux

    - The 'Open Printing Database' maintains a list of printers that are compatible with Linux.
        Brother, HP, and Xerox printers are pretty reliably compatible.


    - Most printers are recognized automatically when plugged into a USB port, but they are not
        necessarily automatically configured.

- CUPS

    - CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) was developed in the late 1990s.  It is a modular
        printing system that makes configuring and printing with most modern printers easy
        and painless.


    - CUPS uses PostScript as the final printer data stream.  It accepts input in ASCII text,
        PDF, HP/GL, and raster image formats, then runs them through a filter to transform
        them into PostScript.

      The PostScript is then passed to a software layer that converts the data to a rasterized
        format that can be converted by various drivers to printer-specific language formats.

      The data stream is then passed to the back-end filters that transfer printer commands to
        printers or other printing devices.


    - CUPS uses PDD (PostScript Printer Description) files to define the features available 
        in each supported printer.  This allows CUPS to interact with features such as paper
        trays, different paper sizes, different print qualities, duplex, color/B&W, and more.
