CHAPTER 12 - NETWORKING
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Basic Networking Concepts

    - This book uses primarily IPv4, since it is still much more common on hosts.  Many
        ISP's use IPv6 for their backbones.


    - Basic Definitions

        1. A 'node' is any device connected to and acessible on a network, including computers,
             routers, printers, etc.

        2. A 'host' is a node that is a computer attached to the network.

        3. The 'Internet Protocol' allows computers to communicate.  IP is a best-effort, packet
             switching protocol used to transmit data packets from one network node to another.
             It is not reliable since packets can be lost or dropped for a number of reasons.

        4. The 'Transmission Control Protocol' sits on top of IP.  It provides reliable communications
             and flow control, including full duplex (communications can go in both directions
             at the same time).

        5. A 'network' is a web-like (or net-like) structure of communications system that allows
             connected nodes to communicate with each other.


    - Network Definitions

        1. A 'NIC' is a network interface controller that is either built into a computer 
             motherboard or added as a pluggable device card.

        2. A 'network node' is any device connected to a network and is addressable by other
             devices such that a connection can be made.

        3. A 'switch' is a hardware device used to connect multiple nodes together on a logical
             network segment.  The switch is connected to each node with an Ethernet cable.
             They are physical-layer devices only.

        4. A 'router' is a device that routes data packets between 2 or more networks based on the
             destination IP address contained in the data packets.  Routers have IP addresses 
             for each network to which they connect, and are visible to other devices on the
             network.

        5. At least one router on the network is the 'default gateway' to other networks or the
             rest of the internet.  If a data packet is sent by a host and there are no other routes
             defined, the default gateway sends the pacekt to the next router on the way to its
             final destination.

        6. A 'connection' is a logical link between 2 nodes on a network.  Connections exist at
             each layer of the TCP/IP stack.



- MAC Addresses

    - A 'MAC address' is a unique hardware address assigned to each NIC that provides the
        hardware as a means of identification.  They are hard-coded by the manufacturer,
        but they can be spoofed in software.


    - MAC addresses consist of 6 2-digit hex numbers, separated by colons.  The first 3
        numbers identify the vendor, and last 3 are specific for that vendor.

        08:00:27:81:ec:cc


    - We can use the 'ip addr' command to see installed NICs with their MAC and IP addresses.

        # Get NIC information
        $ ip addr

        1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
            link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
            inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 ::1/128 scope host
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 08:00:27:e1:0c:10 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 10.0.2.7/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp0s3
               valid_lft 1057sec preferred_lft 1057sec
            inet6 fe80::b7f2:97cf:36d2:b13e/64 scope link noprefixroute
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

        The first entry is the local interface (lo) which is used by many Linux tasks and 
          applications to communicate within the host.

        The second entry, 'enp0s3', is how Linux sees the first virtual network adapter on a 
          VirtualBox VM.  


    - All networked devices have a MAC address, and the 'ip' command enables us to see
        the MAC and IP addresses of the 'neighbor' hosts with which we have communicated.

        # List neighbors
        $ ip neigh
        10.0.2.1 dev enp0s3 lladdr 52:54:00:12:35:00 REACHABLE

        # If nothing comes up, force communication with the router/gateway and try again
        $ ping -c2 _gateway ; ip neigh

        The result we get is the virtual router in our virtual network.  


    - We can also use the 'arp' command to view the MAC addresses.

        # Display devices by DNS name
        $ arp

        # Display devices by IP address
        $ arp -n


    - The 'ip' command is designed to replace ifconfig, arp, and some other network commands.
        For now, these other commands are still available (and probably will be for years).



- IP Addresses

    - An IPv4 address is 4 octets (32 bits total).

        255.255.255.0
        10.0.2.7


    - An IPv6 address is 8 sections of 4 hex digits (128 bits total).

        # Long version
        2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329

        # Short version (with leading zeros and consecutive sections of zeros omitted)
        2001:db8::ff00:42:8329


    - The loopback IPv4 address is 127.0.0.1 (::1/128 in IPv6).  We can ping both addresses.
        The ping command sends a special ICMP data packet to the target IP address

        # Ping ipv6 localhost
        $ ping -c2 ::1

        # Ping ipv4 localhost
        $ ping -c2 127.0.0.1

        # Note that we can also ping remote hosts
        $ ping -c2 www.example.com


    - The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is responsible for global coordination
        and management of IP addresses.  The organization coordinates the assignment of
        blocks of addresses to large geographic-political entities.  These entities assign
        them to customers like ISPs.
