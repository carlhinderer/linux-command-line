CHAPTER 12 - NETWORKING
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Basic Networking Concepts

    - This book uses primarily IPv4, since it is still much more common on hosts.  Many
        ISP's use IPv6 for their backbones.


    - Basic Definitions

        1. A 'node' is any device connected to and acessible on a network, including computers,
             routers, printers, etc.

        2. A 'host' is a node that is a computer attached to the network.

        3. The 'Internet Protocol' allows computers to communicate.  IP is a best-effort, packet
             switching protocol used to transmit data packets from one network node to another.
             It is not reliable since packets can be lost or dropped for a number of reasons.

        4. The 'Transmission Control Protocol' sits on top of IP.  It provides reliable communications
             and flow control, including full duplex (communications can go in both directions
             at the same time).

        5. A 'network' is a web-like (or net-like) structure of communications system that allows
             connected nodes to communicate with each other.


    - Network Definitions

        1. A 'NIC' is a network interface controller that is either built into a computer 
             motherboard or added as a pluggable device card.

        2. A 'network node' is any device connected to a network and is addressable by other
             devices such that a connection can be made.

        3. A 'switch' is a hardware device used to connect multiple nodes together on a logical
             network segment.  The switch is connected to each node with an Ethernet cable.
             They are physical-layer devices only.

        4. A 'router' is a device that routes data packets between 2 or more networks based on the
             destination IP address contained in the data packets.  Routers have IP addresses 
             for each network to which they connect, and are visible to other devices on the
             network.

        5. At least one router on the network is the 'default gateway' to other networks or the
             rest of the internet.  If a data packet is sent by a host and there are no other routes
             defined, the default gateway sends the pacekt to the next router on the way to its
             final destination.

        6. A 'connection' is a logical link between 2 nodes on a network.  Connections exist at
             each layer of the TCP/IP stack.
