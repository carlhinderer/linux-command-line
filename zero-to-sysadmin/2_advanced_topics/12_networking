CHAPTER 12 - NETWORKING
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Basic Networking Concepts

    - This book uses primarily IPv4, since it is still much more common on hosts.  Many
        ISP's use IPv6 for their backbones.


    - Basic Definitions

        1. A 'node' is any device connected to and acessible on a network, including computers,
             routers, printers, etc.

        2. A 'host' is a node that is a computer attached to the network.

        3. The 'Internet Protocol' allows computers to communicate.  IP is a best-effort, packet
             switching protocol used to transmit data packets from one network node to another.
             It is not reliable since packets can be lost or dropped for a number of reasons.

        4. The 'Transmission Control Protocol' sits on top of IP.  It provides reliable communications
             and flow control, including full duplex (communications can go in both directions
             at the same time).

        5. A 'network' is a web-like (or net-like) structure of communications system that allows
             connected nodes to communicate with each other.


    - Network Definitions

        1. A 'NIC' is a network interface controller that is either built into a computer 
             motherboard or added as a pluggable device card.

        2. A 'network node' is any device connected to a network and is addressable by other
             devices such that a connection can be made.

        3. A 'switch' is a hardware device used to connect multiple nodes together on a logical
             network segment.  The switch is connected to each node with an Ethernet cable.
             They are physical-layer devices only.

        4. A 'router' is a device that routes data packets between 2 or more networks based on the
             destination IP address contained in the data packets.  Routers have IP addresses 
             for each network to which they connect, and are visible to other devices on the
             network.

        5. At least one router on the network is the 'default gateway' to other networks or the
             rest of the internet.  If a data packet is sent by a host and there are no other routes
             defined, the default gateway sends the packet to the next router on the way to its
             final destination.

        6. A 'connection' is a logical link between 2 nodes on a network.  Connections exist at
             each layer of the TCP/IP stack.



- MAC Addresses

    - A 'MAC address' is a unique hardware address assigned to each NIC that provides the
        hardware as a means of identification.  They are hard-coded by the manufacturer,
        but they can be spoofed in software.


    - MAC addresses consist of 6 2-digit hex numbers, separated by colons.  The first 3
        numbers identify the vendor, and last 3 are specific for that vendor.

        08:00:27:81:ec:cc


    - We can use the 'ip addr' command to see installed NICs with their MAC and IP addresses.

        # Get NIC information
        $ ip addr

        1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
            link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
            inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 ::1/128 scope host
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 08:00:27:e1:0c:10 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 10.0.2.7/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp0s3
               valid_lft 1057sec preferred_lft 1057sec
            inet6 fe80::b7f2:97cf:36d2:b13e/64 scope link noprefixroute
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

        The first entry is the local interface (lo) which is used by many Linux tasks and 
          applications to communicate within the host.

        The second entry, 'enp0s3', is how Linux sees the first virtual network adapter on a 
          VirtualBox VM.  


    - All networked devices have a MAC address, and the 'ip' command enables us to see
        the MAC and IP addresses of the 'neighbor' hosts with which we have communicated.

        # List neighbors
        $ ip neigh
        10.0.2.1 dev enp0s3 lladdr 52:54:00:12:35:00 REACHABLE

        # If nothing comes up, force communication with the router/gateway and try again
        $ ping -c2 _gateway ; ip neigh

        The result we get is the virtual router in our virtual network.  


    - We can also use the 'arp' command to view the MAC addresses.

        # Display devices by DNS name
        $ arp

        # Display devices by IP address
        $ arp -n


    - The 'ip' command is designed to replace ifconfig, arp, and some other network commands.
        For now, these other commands are still available (and probably will be for years).



- IP Addresses

    - An IPv4 address is 4 octets (32 bits total).

        255.255.255.0
        10.0.2.7


    - An IPv6 address is 8 sections of 4 hex digits (128 bits total).

        # Long version
        2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329

        # Short version (with leading zeros and consecutive sections of zeros omitted)
        2001:db8::ff00:42:8329


    - The loopback IPv4 address is 127.0.0.1 (::1/128 in IPv6).  We can ping both addresses.
        The ping command sends a special ICMP data packet to the target IP address

        # Ping ipv6 localhost
        $ ping -c2 ::1

        # Ping ipv4 localhost
        $ ping -c2 127.0.0.1

        # Note that we can also ping remote hosts
        $ ping -c2 www.example.com


    - The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is responsible for global coordination
        and management of IP addresses.  The organization coordinates the assignment of
        blocks of addresses to large geographic-political entities.  These entities assign
        them to customers like ISPs.

    - Layers

        1. Application layer - Message

        2. Transport layer - TCP Segment

        3. Internet layer - Packet

        4. Data link layer - Frame

        5. Physical layer - Bits



- Simple TCP/IP Example

        1. In the application layer, web browser sends an HTTP message to the remote host, 
             www.example.com, to send back the web page data.


        2. The transport layer encapsulates the message in a TCP datagram with the IP 
             address of the remote web server as the destination.  

           Along with the usual request packet, this packet now includes the source port from 
             which the request will originate (usually a very high number random port) so 
             that the return data knows which port the browser is listening on.  It also
             includes the destination port on the remote host (80).


        3. The internet layer encapsulates the TCP datagram in a packet that also contains the
             internet packet in a frame that includes both the source and destination IP
             addresses.


        4. The data link layer uses the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify the physical
             MAC address of the default router and encapsulates the internet packet in a frame
             that includes both the source and destination MAC addresses.


        5. The frame is sent over the wire (CAT5 or CAT6).  If a wireless NIC is communicating
             with a wireless router, the wireless router is the default (gateway) router.


        6. The default router opens the datagram and determines the destination IP address.  The
             router uses its own routing table to determine the IP address of the next router 
             that will take the frame on the next step of its journey.  

           The router then re-encapsulates the frame in a new datagram that contains its own MAC
             as the source and MAC of the next router as its destination.  


        - Routers perform their routing tasks at Layer 3.  Switches are invisble to all protocols
            at Layers 2 and above, so they do not affect the transmission of the data in any 
            logical way.  

          The function of a switch is only to provide a simple means to connect multiple hosts into
            a single physical network via ethernet cables.



- CIDR - Network Notation and Configuration

    - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines a notation methodology for network addressing
        used to specify the network portion of an IP address.


    - Network Classes

      Class  Start       End               Subnet Mask     CIDR   # of Networks    IP Addrs/Network
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      E      240.0.0.0   255.255.255.255                          Undefined        Undefined


    - Network Class Details

        - Class A, B, and C are unicast address ranges (packets are sent to a single host).  

          Class D is multicast (packets are sent to all hosts on a defined network), and is essentially
            unused.

          Class E was reserved for future expansion but was never used.


        - In the early years of the internet, addresses were doled out in wasteful ways, with
            Class C-sized orgs getting B addresses and Class B-sized orgs getting A addresses.
            Thus, a few orgs were assigned very large number of addresses.


        - The class of a network is defined by the first 4 bits of the address, not the subnet mask
            (or the CIDR equivalent of the subnet mask).  This meant that large networks could 
            not be broken down into smaller networks, because routing tables in routers only have
            one entry per network.


        - The 'sipcalc' program provides a lot of information about network classes.

            # Install sipcalc
            $ dnf -y install sipcalc

            # Provide network data for a class B network
            $ sipcalc 10.125.0.0/16



    - Along Came a CIDR

        - CIDR notation (1993) was introduced as a means of extending the IPv4 address space,
            which was rapidly running out of addresses.

          It accomplishes this by making it possible for orgs to more efficiently use the public
            IPv4 address ranges by opening up some previously reserved ranges.


        - Basically, it introduced ranges of private addresses, which any org can use freely
            inside their internal network.  Therefore, it is no longer necessary for every 
            computer to have an assigned public IP address.  Of course, the private IP 
            addresses can communicate inside of an internal network.


            CIDR Block         Address Range                    # of IP Addresses
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            10.0.0.0/8         10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255        16,777,216
            172.16.0.0/12      172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255      1,048,576
            192.168.0.0/16     192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255    65,536


        - We can see how many addresses each network can assign, based on the number of bits
            in the CIDR.

    - Variable Length Subnet Masking

        - CIDR brings a new approach to the old netmask, called VLSM (Variable Length Subnet
            Masking), that lets orgs create more managable subnets from the private address
            space.


        - For instance, say we want to take the private space available in:

            172.16.0.0/12

          We can split this space into 16 equal sized subnets:

            # Split address space into subnets
            $ sipcalc 172.16.0.0/12 -s 16

- DHCP Client Configuration

    - Each NIC on your computer provides a physical connection to your network.  Most computers
        only have 1 NIC for a wired connection and 1 NIC for a wireless connection.

      Some Linux machines have multiple wired NICs, and are used as inexpensive routers for 
        internal networks.  


    - On Fedora, the default is to use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for all network 
        interfaces.  This requires a DHCP server to be located on the local network.  

      On our VM, our virtual router on our virtual network provides DHCP services.


    - The DHCP server can provide a large number of network configuration components.  These are
        the ones that are absolutely necessary:

        1. An IP address
        2. The IP address of the router/gateway device
        3. The IP address of at least 1 name server


    - Other components that may be included:

        - Up to 2 additional name server IP addresses

        - The domain name of the local network, so that a command like ping doesn't require
            the complete domain name.

        - The subnet mask



- NIC Naming Conventions

    - The naming conventions for NICs have changed several times over the years.  Currently,
        the udev device manager detects when new devices (like NICs) have been added to the
        system, and systemd renames them according to a hierarchical naming scheme.

        # See renaming of NIC
        $ dmesg | grep eth

        [    4.791454] e1000 0000:00:03.0 eth0: (PCI:33MHz:32-bit) 08:00:27:e1:0c:10
        [    4.791520] e1000 0000:00:03.0 eth0: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
        [    5.294678] e1000 0000:00:03.0 enp0s3: renamed from eth0


    - There is now a convoluted 5-tier scheme for renaming the NICs:

        1. Firmware or BIOS-provided index numbers (ie 'eno1')
        2. Firmware or BIOS-provided PCI Express hot-plug slot indexes (ie 'ens1')
        3. Names incorporating physical locations (ie 'enp2s0')
        4. Names incorporating the interface's MAC address
        5. Traditional kernel naming scheme (ie 'eth0')



- NIC Configuration Files

    - By default, most current distro releases default to DHCP configuration.  Hosts using
        DHCP for network configuration no longer requrire interface config files at all

      However, non-standard configuration of the NICs is still accomplished with 'ifcfg-X' 
        files in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts file.  For instance, our 'enp0s3' NIC
        would have a config file named 'ifcfg-enp0s3'.

      The 'nmcli' (Network Manager CLI) tool can be used to change the config file for an 
        interface from the command line.


    - Creating an Interface Configuration File

        # Navigate to scripts directory (should be empty)
        $ cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

        # Create a new config script for enp0s3
        $ nmcli connection add save yes type ethernet ifname enp0s3 con-name enp0s3


        # Verify that enp0s3 has an ip address assigned
        $ ip addr show enp0s3

        # Turn enp0s3 off and verify it is off
        $ ip link set enp0s3 down
        $ ip addr show enp0s3



- The Interface Configuration File

    - Now, we can look at the newly created config file:  

        # View contents of new config file
        $ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3

        # Set primary and secondary DNS servers
        $ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 IPv4.dns "10.0.2.1 8.8.8.8"


    - The Network File

        The network file is old and deprecated, but you may still see it on older systems.
          The hostname was set in this file.

        Now, the hostname is set in the /etc/hostname file.


    - The Route-<Interface> File

        This file may also be present in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, for instance named
          'route-enp0s3'.  It allows defining routes to entire network.

        It is rare on Linux clients, but will be present on a system like a router, for instance.


    - Other Network Files

        In previous years, executable scripts were also found in the network-scripts directory,
          but they were removed to comply with the FHS.



- Network Startup

    - With the advent of wireless networks and mobile devices, reconfiguring the NICs for 
        each new wireless network became complicated and time-consuming.  

      The NetworkManager service starts the network services during startup, and provides
        a management interface while the host is running.


    - The NetworkManager service (2004) simplifies and automates network configurations
        and connections, especially wireless connections.

      It integrates with udev and D-Bus to deal with pluggable devices and various wireless
        networks.  



- Name Services

    - The 'Domain Name System' provides the database to be used in the translation
        from human-readable hostnames to IP addresses.

      The primary function of the BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) system is that of
        a domain name resolver that uses this database.


    - In small networks, the /etc/hosts file on each host can be used as a name resolver.
        However, maintaining copies of this file on several hosts can become very 
        time-consuming and error-prone.

      So, it makes sense, even in small networks, to convert to running 



- How a Name Search Works

    1. First, I type 'www.example.com' into my web browser.

    2. The browser sends the request to the OS.

    3. The OS checks the /etc/hosts file to see if the name is defined there.  If so,
         the IP address defined is returned to the browser.

    4. If the name is not in /etc/hosts, the URL is sent to the first name server
         specified in /etc/resolv.conf, which in this case is our local name server.  If 
         the server has the name cached, it's IP address is returned.

    5. Otherwise, the local name server sends the request to a remote name server.  This
         remote server is either a forwarder (name server from ISP, Google, etc.) or a
         top-level root name server.  The top-level server responds with the authoritative
         server for that domain.

    6. The local name server is configured to use the root name servers so that the 
         authoritative server is returned.

    7. The local name server sends the query to the authoritative name server, which returns
         the IP address for www.example.com.

    8. The browser uses the IP address to send a request to the web page.



- Using the /etc/hosts File

    - Most computers need little configuration to obtain name services, since the name server
        in their /etc/resolv.conf is added through DHCP at boot time.

      For hosts that are configured statically, the /etc/resolv.conf is usually configured
        at installation time by the SysAdmin.


    - Many name servers you'll find on public networks are not reliable.  So, we can add one
        Google or Cloudflare name server to our /etc/resolv.conf to ensure we have a reliable
        name server available.


    - In the absence of centralized name services, we can add names to our /etc/hosts file:

        # Initially, only the localhosts entries are present
        $ cat /etc/hosts

        127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
        ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6


        # We can ping those predefined name entries
        $ ping -c2 localhost
        $ ping -c2 localhost4
        $ ping -c2 localhost6


    - Now, we can add an entry to /etc/hosts:

        # Get our IP address
        $ ip addr show enp0s3
        ...
        inet 10.0.2.7/24
        ...


        # And add an entry for our local machine to /etc/hosts
        10.0.2.7        studentvm1 svm1 vm1 s1


        # Now, we can ping these entries
        $ ping -c2 studentvm1
        $ ping -c2 svm1
        $ ping -c2 vm1



- Introduction to Network Routing

    - Every computer attached to a network needs to know where to send TCP/IP packets when
        they leave the localhost.  This is often straightforward, because many network 
        environments only have 2 options for 

        1. Send the packet to a device on the local network (technically the subnet its on)
        2. Send the packet to a different network


    - Routing decisions are fairly simple for most hosts:

        1. If the destination host is on the same network, send the data directly to the
             destination host.

        2. If the destination host is on a remote network that is reachable via a local 
             gateway listed in the routing table, send it to the explicitly defined
             gateway.

        3. If the destination host is on a remote network and there is no other entry that
             defines a route to that host, send the data to the default gateway.



- The Routing Table

    - All network devices need to make decisions about where to route TCP/IP packets.  The 
        routing table provides the configuration information required to make those decisions.

      The routing table for any host on the network is used to provide the single route 
        available to that localhost and to determine whether to send packets to the default
        gateway router.  


    - There are a few different commands to display the routing table.  The 'route' and 'netstat'
        commands were used historically, but are now deprecated.

        # Old command to display routing table
        $ route -n

        # Another old command to display routing table
        $ netstat -rn

    
    - Today, the 'ip' command is used to display the routing table:

        # Display routing table
        $ ip route


    - The 'traceroute' command is used to view the complete route our packets will take to
        a remote host.  

        # Uses UDP, doesn't get good results
        $ traceroute www.example.org

        # Uses ICMP instead, gets better results
        $ traceroute -I www.example.org


    - The 'mtr' (Matt's traceroute) command is the modern successor to traceroute.

        # Display names for hops
        $ mtr example.org

        # Display IP address for hops
        $ mtr -n example.org


    - The 'whois' command can be used to get information about who owns an IP address, but this
        information is often wrong.

        # Get information about an IP
        $ whois 93.184.216.34



- iptraf-ng

    - In troubleshooting network connection problems, it can be helpful to use a tool like
        'iptraf-ng' (IP Traffic Next Generation) to monitor network traffic on one or more
        interfaces.

        # Install iptraf-ng
        $ dnf install iptraf-ng


        # Ping the router from a terminal window
        $ ping router

        # Now, start iptraf-ng in another terminal window, should be able to see pings
        $ iptraf-ng
