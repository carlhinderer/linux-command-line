CHAPTER 9 - COMMAND LINE PROGRAMMING
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Output to the Display

    - The 'echo' command prints data to the screen.  

        # Print home directory
        $ echo "My home directory." ; ls

        # The -e flag enables escape sequences
        $ echo "FirstLine.\nSecondLine"


    - The 'printf' command (print formatted) command allows more complex formatting.  The command
        can also use all the C printf specs, so there are a ton of built-in formatting options.

        # Escape sequences work
        $ printf "FirstLine.\nSecondLine"

        # Get details about C spces
        $ man 3 printf



- Variables

    - Variables are assigned without a $, but they are accessed with a $.

        # Set and print variable
        $ echo $MyVar ; MyVar="Hello World" ; echo $MyVar

        # Variables can be unset and returned to a null value
        $ unset MyVar

        # String variables can be combined in various ways
        $ Var1="Hello World!" ; Var2="Welcome to Bash CLI programming."
        $ printf "$Var1\n$Var2\n" ;


    - Bash can perform basic integer math:

        # Basic integer math
        $ Var1="7" ; Var2="9" ; echo "Result = $((Var1∗Var2))"
        Result = 63


- Control Operators

    - Return Codes

        - Every bash statement generates a return code.

            # Check return code of last command run with $? operator
            $ ll ; echo "RC = $"
            ...
            RC = 0


            # Nonzero return code means command was unsuccessful
            $ ll /root ; echo "RC = $?"
            ls: cannot open directory '/root': Permission denied
            RC = 2


    - The Operators

        - The ; operator allows multiple statements on a single line.  A semicolon on the last
            statement can beither implicit or explicit.


        - The && operator runs the second command only if the first is successful.

            # Create dirctory and file
            $ Dir=chapter9
            $ mkdir $Dir/subdirectory && touch $Dir/subdirectory/testfile


        - The || operator runs the second command only if the first is unsuccessful.

            # Handle unsuccessful command
            $ Dir=chapter9
            $ mkdir $Dir/subdirectory || echo "New file was not created."

            mkdir: cannot create directory ‘chapter9/subdirectory’: Permission denied
            New file was not created.



- Program Flow Control

    - The if Statement

        - The syntax for the 'if' statement is:

            if condition1; then list1; [ elif condition2; then list2; ] ... [ else list3; ] fi



    - true and false

        - The 'true' command always produces a return code of 0, and the 'false' command always
            produces a return code of 1.

            # Return code 0
            $ true ; echo $?
            0

            # Return code 1
            $ false ; echo $?
            1

            # 'true' with operators
            $ true && echo "True" || echo "False"
            True

            # 'false' with operators
            $ false && echo "True" || echo "False"
            False



    - Logical Operators

        - The functional syntax of these comparison operators is 1 or 2 arguments with an 
            operator that are placed within square braces.  We have a 'list' of program
            statements that are executed if the statement is true, and an optional list
            of program stratements if the condition is false.

            # If only
            if [ arg1 operator arg2 ] ; then list

            # If/else
            if [ arg1 operator arg2 ] ; then list ; else list ; fi


        - The square braces are the traditional Bash symbols that are equivalent to the   
            'test' command.  

            # If only
            if test arg1 operator arg2 ; then list


        - There is also a more recent double square bracket syntax that has a few 
            advantages.

            # If only
            if [[ arg1 operator arg2 ]] ; then list
