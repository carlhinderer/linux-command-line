CHAPTER 13 - SYSTEMD
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Controversy

    - SystemV start scripts and the 'init' program are the old method of Linux startup
        sequence.  systemd using targets is the new method.  The 'init' and 'systemd' 
        programs start and manage all other processes.


    - SystemV is more open.  Startup is accomplished using bash scripts, all of which are
        open and easily understandable.  SystemV is simple and it does one thing well.


    - systemd is also open source, but it is a complex system of large compiled binaries.  It
        starts as many services as possible in parallel, which speeds up the overall startup.
        It also manages hardware, processes, filesystem mounts, and much more.


    - In any case, the choice has likely already been made for you by the developers of the 
        distro.  



- The systemd Suite

    - The systemd suite is a large set of programs all designed to work together in order to
        manage nearly every aspect of a running Linux system.


    - There are many componenets in the systemd suite:

        systemd Utilities
          systemctl  journalctl  notify  analyze  cgls  cgtop  loginctl  nspawn

        systemd Daemons
          systemd  journald  networkd  logind  session

        systemd Targets
          bootmode  basic  shutdown  reboot
          [Multi-user]  dbus  dlog  telephony  logind
          [Graphical]  user-session
          [User-session]  display-service  tizen-service

        systemd Core
          manager  systemd  namespace  cgroup  log  dbus
          [Unit]  service  snapshot  timer  path  mount  socket  target  swap
          [Login]  multiseat  session  inhibit  pam

        systemd Libraries
          dbus-1  libpam  libcap  libcryptsetup  tcpwrapper  libaudit  libnotify

        Linux Kernel
          cgroups  autofs  kdbus



- Practical Structure

    - The structure of systemd is contained in its many configuration files, known as 'Unit'
        files.  Unit files are ASCII plain text files that can be created and modified by 
        SysAdmins.

        
        systemd Unit         Description
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        .automount           Used to implement plug-and-play and mounting of filesystems

        .device              Defines hardware and virtual devices available in /dev

        .mount               Defines a mount point on the Linux filesystem

        .scope               Defines and manages a set of system processes

        .service             Defines processes that are managed by systemd

        .slice               Defines a slice, a conceptual division of system resources

        .socket              Defines IPC sockets such as network sockets

        .swap                Defines swap devices or files

        .target              Defines groups of unit files for sync points, runlevels, services

        .timer               Defines timers that can initiate programs at specified times
