CHAPTER 13 - SYSTEMD
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Controversy

    - SystemV start scripts and the 'init' program are the old method of Linux startup
        sequence.  systemd using targets is the new method.  The 'init' and 'systemd' 
        programs start and manage all other processes.


    - SystemV is more open.  Startup is accomplished using bash scripts, all of which are
        open and easily understandable.  SystemV is simple and it does one thing well.


    - systemd is also open source, but it is a complex system of large compiled binaries.  It
        starts as many services as possible in parallel, which speeds up the overall startup.
        It also manages hardware, processes, filesystem mounts, and much more.


    - In any case, the choice has likely already been made for you by the developers of the 
        distro.  



- The systemd Suite

    - The systemd suite is a large set of programs all designed to work together in order to
        manage nearly every aspect of a running Linux system.


    - There are many componenets in the systemd suite:

        systemd Utilities
          systemctl  journalctl  notify  analyze  cgls  cgtop  loginctl  nspawn

        systemd Daemons
          systemd  journald  networkd  logind  session

        systemd Targets
          bootmode  basic  shutdown  reboot
          [Multi-user]  dbus  dlog  telephony  logind
          [Graphical]  user-session
          [User-session]  display-service  tizen-service

        systemd Core
          manager  systemd  namespace  cgroup  log  dbus
          [Unit]  service  snapshot  timer  path  mount  socket  target  swap
          [Login]  multiseat  session  inhibit  pam

        systemd Libraries
          dbus-1  libpam  libcap  libcryptsetup  tcpwrapper  libaudit  libnotify

        Linux Kernel
          cgroups  autofs  kdbus



- Practical Structure

    - The structure of systemd is contained in its many configuration files, known as 'Unit'
        files.  Unit files are ASCII plain text files that can be created and modified by 
        SysAdmins.

        
        systemd Unit         Description
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        .automount           Used to implement plug-and-play and mounting of filesystems

        .device              Defines hardware and virtual devices available in /dev

        .mount               Defines a mount point on the Linux filesystem

        .scope               Defines and manages a set of system processes

        .service             Defines processes that are managed by systemd

        .slice               Defines a slice, a conceptual division of system resources

        .socket              Defines IPC sockets such as network sockets

        .swap                Defines swap devices or files

        .target              Defines groups of unit files for sync points, runlevels, services

        .timer               Defines timers that can initiate programs at specified times



- systemctl

    - systemd provides the 'systemctl' command, which is used to start and stop services, 
        configure whether to launch them at system startup, and monitor the current status
        of all running services.  

        # Look at systemctl logs
        $ systemctl


        # List unit files
        $ systemctl list-unit-files

        # List unit files for timers (either will work)
        $ systemctl list-unit-files -t timer
        $ systemctl list-timers


        # List all service units (installed services, enabled or disabled)
        $ systemctl --all -t service


    - Unit files are stored in /usr/lib/systemd.  The /etc/systemd directory contains sym links
        to the unit files necessary to the local config for this host.

        # The 'default.target' unit file determines which runlevel target the system will boot to
        $ cat /etc/systemd/system/default.target



- Service Units

    - Most of the time, a Fedora installation installs and starts a bunch of services that are
        not actually needed.  This is a security risk, and these services should be stopped and
        disabled, or possibly uninstalled.  


        # List all installed services
        $ systemctl --all -t service

        UNIT                           LOAD      ACTIVE SUB        DESCRIPTION
        <snip>
        chronyd.service                loaded    active running    NTP client/server
        crond.service                  loaded    active running    Command Scheduler
        cups.service                   loaded    active running    CUPS Scheduler
        dbus-daemon.service            loaded    active running    D-Bus System Message Bus
        <snip>
        ● ip6tables.service           not-found inactive dead     ip6tables.service
        ● ipset.service               not-found inactive dead     ipset.service
        ● iptables.service            not-found inactive dead     iptables.service
        <snip>
        firewalld.service              loaded    active   running  firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
        <snip>
        ● ntpd.service                not-found inactive dead     ntpd.service
        ● ntpdate.service             not-found inactive dead     ntpdate.service
        pcscd.service                  loaded    active   running  PC/SC Smart Card Daemon


      The 'not-found' services are the ones systemd is aware of but which are not installed.  If
        we want to run them, the packages that contain them must be installed first.


    - For instance, we see the 'pcscd.service' is running.  This is for smart card readers, which we
        have no need for on our VM.  

        # Check status of service
        $ systemctl status pcscd.service

        # Stop and disable the service, the re-check its status
        $ systemctl stop pcscd ; systemctl disable pcscd
        $ systemctl status pcscd


    - We can also check the status of the system runlevel targets.

        # Check runlevel targets
        $ systemctl status multi-user.target
        $ systemctl status graphical.target
        $ systemctl status default.target



- Mount Units

    - A mount unit defines all the parameters necessary to mount a file system on a designated
        mount point.  systemd can manage mount units with more flexibility than the /etc/fstab
        file.

      However, systemd still uses the /etc/fstab file for filesystem config and mounting.  It 
        uses the 'systemd-fstab-generator' utility for creating transient mounts in the fstab
        file.


    - Here, we'll look at our previously created 'TestFS' filesystem and mount:

        # Check status of unit
        $ systemctl status TestFS.mount

        # Unmount the unit
        $ systemctl stop TestFS.mount ; systemctl status TestFS.mount

        # Now remount it
        $ systemctl start TestFS.mount ; systemctl status TestFS.mount


    - Note that we could have accomplished the same thing using the regular 'mount' and 'umount'
        commands.  Automating it with systemctl can save us some work, though.



- systemd Timers

    - We have already seen how we can use 'cron' and 'at' to run commands and scripts.  We
        will now look at using systemd timers to accomplish a similar function.

      There are a few things we can do with systemd timers that are not possible with cron.
        Whereas cron can only be triggered by real-time dates and times, systemd can be
        triggered based on other events.  

      For instance, we can set an action to be performed a certain elapsed time after system boot.
        These type of timers are called 'monotonic timers'.


    - These are the timers available:

        Timer               Monotonic     Definition
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        OnActiveSec=        Yes           Defines timer relative to moment the timer itself
                                            is activated

        OnBootSec=          Yes           Defines timer relative to when the machine was booted

        OnStartupSec=       Yes           Defines timer relative to when systemd was started

        OnUnitActiveSpec=   Yes           Defines timer relative to when the unit timer is activating
                                            was last activated

        OnUnitInactiveSpec= Yes           Defines timer relative to when the unit timer is activating
                                            was last deactivated

        OnCalendar                        Defines realtime workers with calendar event expressions



    - Time Specification

        - The systemd specification for dates and times is different from cron's.  

            DOW YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

            DOW is optional, * can be used for the other 6 columns
            Defalt: Today 00:00:00


        - The 'systemd-analyze calendar' tool will parse an input date or time and convert
            it to the systemd format.

            # Get formatted date
            $ systemd-analyze calendar 2030-06-17

            # Get multiple dates
            $ systemd-analyze calendar 2030-06-07 2032-08-19

            # Get formatted date/time
            $ systemd-analyze calendar "2030-06-17 15:21:16"



    - Timer Configuration

        - Now, we'll create a timer that logs the results of the 'free' command.  First, we'll
            create the script 'freemem.sh':

            # File /usr/local/bin/freemem.sh

            #!/usr/bin/bash
            /usr/bin/date >> /tmp/freemem.log
            /usr/bin/free >> /tmp/freemem.log


        - Now, we'll create our service unit 'freemem.service':

            # File /etc/systemd/system/freemem.service

            [Unit]
            Description=Logs free memory to /tmp/freemem.log
            Wants=freemem.timer

            [Service]
            ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/freemem.sh

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target


        - Finally, we'll create the timer 'freemem.timer', which will cause the script to 
            execute once a minute:

            # File /etc/systemd/system/freemem.timer

            [Unit]
            Description=Logs free memory to /tmp/freemem.log
            Requires=freemem.service

            [Timer]
            Unit=freemem.service
            OnCalendar=∗-∗-∗ ∗:∗:00

            [Install]
            WantedBy=timers.target


        - Now, we start the timer, and verify that our script is running:

            # Start timer
            $ systemctl start freemem.timer

            # Verify that the timer is running
            $ systemctl -t timer

            # Verify the log file is being updated
            $ tail -f /tmp/freemem.log


        - We will notice in the script that the job is running at various random times within
            each minute.  This is because the default accuracy time is 1 minute.  We can change
            it to 0.1 seconds, which will make it run within 0.1 seconds of each minute.

            # Add to [Timer] section of freemem.timer
            [Timer]
            AccuracySec=.01s

            # Now, force systemd to reload all unit files
            $ systemctl daemon-reload


        - We can also enable or disable the timer to run on reboot:

            # Enable on reboot
            $ systemctl enable freemem.timer

            # Stop and disable
            $ systemctl stop freemem.timer
            $ systemctl disable freemem.timer



- systemd-analyze

    - The 'systemd-analyze' tool allows us to look at which processes take the most time 
        to start up and other statistics.

        # Get services that take the most time to initialize
        $ systemd-analyze blame

        # Create svg file graphing startup times
        $ systemd-analyze plot > system.svg



- Journals

    - Fedora has a /var/log directory full of log files, all of which are composed of ASCII 
        plain text and can be viewed by standard text tools.  

      systemd keeps logs in files called journals with the '.journal' file extension.  These
        journals are stored in a binary format in the /var/log/journal directory.  They are
        accessed and processed into a readable format with the 'journalctl' utility.


        # List all journal entries
        $ journalctl


        # Use the -t option to specify a syslog identifier (such as a service name)
        $ journalctl -t kernel

        # Show all kernel entries
        $ journalctl -k


        # Display messages by priority
        $ journalctl -p2

        # List all boots
        $ journalctl --list-boots


        # Display messages from a timeframe
        $ journalctl -S "2019-05-10 01:00:00" -U "2019-05-10 01:10:05"

        # Display all messages from dhcp client during a timeframe
        $ journalctl -S "2019-05-10 01:00:00" -U "2019-05-10 01:10:05" -t dhclient
