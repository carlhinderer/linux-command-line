CHAPTER 1 - LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------

- The Need For Logical Volume Management

    - Managing disk space has always been a significant task for SysAdmins.  Running out of
        disk space usually led to a long and complex series of tasks.  

      It required taking the system offline, installing a new hard drive, booting to recovery
        mode, creating new partitions and filesystems, changing the /etc/fstab file, and
        rebooting.


    - The introduction LVM has made these tasks much easier.  It provides features like the
        ability to add disk space to a filesystem.  It also allows for a collection of 
        multiple physical hard drives and partitions in a single volume group which can then
        be divided into logical volumes.

      We can do all of this without rebooting or unmounting the original filesystems.



- LVM Structure

    - LVM enables combining multiple physical hard drives into a 'volume group'.  

      The volume group can then be divided into 'logical volumes'.  

      Regular filesystems like EXT4 can then be created on a logical volume.



- Extending a Logical Volume

    - Although we can resize a mounted and active volume while it is in use, this is probably not
        recommended for critical systems.  However, it can and is done frequently.


    - To view existing volumes:

        # List all filesystems
        $ lsblk -i

        # List all volume groups
        $ vgs

        # List all logical volumes
        $ lvs


    - To expand a logical volume from existing free space within the volume group:

        # Expand with existing free space
        $ lvextend -L +2G /dev/fedora_studentvm1/home

        # Expand the ext4 filesystem to fill the new space
        $ resize2fs /dev/fedora_studentvm1/home



- Extending Volume Groups

    - Create a New Volume Group 1

        - Here, we use an existing but unused partition to create a volume group:

            # Verify the amount of space we have left on /dev/sdb
            $ lsblk
            sdb                          8:16   0   20G  0 disk
            |-sdb1                       8:17   0    2G  0 part /TestFS


        - Next, create the physical partitions and volume group:

            # Create 2 physical volumes
            $ pvcreate /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3

            # Create a volume group encompassing both of the new partitions
            $ vgcreate NewVG-01 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3

            # Verify the new volume group
            $ vgs


        - Now, create the logical volume on the new volume group:

            # Create a new logical volume on new volume group
            $ lvcreate -L 2G NewVG-01 --name TestVol1

            # Verify new logical volume
            $ lvs


        - Now, create an EXT4 filesystem on the new volume, mount it temporarily on /mnt,
            and test it by creating a few files:

            # Create ext4 filesystem
            $ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/NewVG--01-TestVol1

            # Mount the new filesystem
            $ mount /dev/mapper/NewVG--01-TestVol1 /mnt

            # Verify the mount
            $ ll /mnt
