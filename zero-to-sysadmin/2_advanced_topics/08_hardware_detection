CHAPTER 8 - HARDWARE DETECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Introduction

    - Hardware detection is the ability to identify what hardware is installed in a Linux host,
        and other information such as vendor, model, serial number, memory, and SSD/hard-drive
        sizes, and other specifying information.


    - The 'lshw' (list hardware) and 'dimdecode' (Desktop Management Interface) both display as
        much hardware information as is available in SMBIOS (System Management BIOS).  These 
        standards are closely related and are managed by the DMTF.


    - SMBIOS is a data storage area on system motherboards that allows the BIOS boot process to
        access data about the system hardware.  The hardware data is collected from the SMBIOS
        and stored in the running system as the /sysfs special filesystem.

      Because the task of collecting hardware data is performed by BIOS during the initial boot,
        the OS does not need to probe hardware directly.  


    - Note that much of the data in SMBIOS was hard-coded by hardware vendors, and was not built
        by probing the hardware directly.  So, it might be wrong.



- dmidecode

    - The 'dmidecode' utility can provide us a ton of hardware information:

        # Make sure printer is enabled
        $ cupsenable Brother-HL-2270DW
        $ lpstat -t

        # Get all information available in SMBIOS
        $ dmidecode | less

        # Get information about individual DMI types (0 is the BIOS itself)
        $ dmidecode -t 0

        # Codes
        #   0   bios
        #   1   assembled system
        #   2   motherboard
        #   4   CPU
        #   16  RAM
        #   17  individual memory slots



- lshw

    - 'lshw' is similar to dmidecode, but it's output is a little more terse.

        # Install lshw
        $ dnf -y install lshw

        # Get hardware summary
        $ lshw | less



- lsusb

    - The 'lsusb' lists devices on the USB bus, including USB hubs and devices connected to
        them.

        # List usb devices
        $ lsusb

        # List devices in tree format
        $ lsusb -t



- usb-devices

    - The 'usb-devices' utility lists devices also, but it provides more information about each
        individual device.

        # List devices, with device detail
        $ usb-devices



- lspci

    - The 'lspci' utility lists devices on the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) and it's
        extensions, PCI-X and PCIe.  This includes motherboard devices like memory and bus
        controllers, as well as devices like audio, Ethernet, SATA, and video devices.

        # List PCI devices
        $ lspci

        # Get verbose output
        $ lspci -v | less

        # Get tree view
        $ lspci -tv



- Cleanup

    - We no longer need the USB printer, so can disable it and remove it from the VM.

        # Disable printer
        $ cd /spool
        $ cupsdisable Brother-HL-2270DW
