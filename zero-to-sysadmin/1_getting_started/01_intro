- Windows and Linux

    - The DEC VAX/VMS operating system was designed with a closed philosophy in order to protect users
        from having to understand the internals of the system.

      Dave Cutler, who wrote VAX/VMS, is also the chief architect of Windows NT.


    - In 1991 in Helsinki, Linus Torvalds was learning Minix, a tiny variant of Linux written by Andrew 
        Tannenbaum.  He thought it had too many deficiencies, so he wrote his own kernel.  


    - For the latest release of the Linux kernel (4.17, June 2018), over 1700 developers have made 13,500
        changes to the kernel alone.



- The Linux Truth

    - Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing
        clever things.


    - The root user can do anything on a Linux machine.  There are no limits of any type on the root user.


    - Non-root users have a few limits placed on them, but they can still do many clever things as well.  The primary
        limits placed on non-root users are intended to prevent them from doing things that interfere with others'
        ability to freely use the Linux host.  This does not prevent users from doing great harm to their own
        user accounts.
