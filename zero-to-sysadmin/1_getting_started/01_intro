CHAPTER 1 - INTRO

- Windows and Linux

    - The DEC VAX/VMS operating system was designed with a closed philosophy in order to protect users
        from having to understand the internals of the system.

      Dave Cutler, who wrote VAX/VMS, is also the chief architect of Windows NT.


    - In 1991 in Helsinki, Linus Torvalds was learning Minix, a tiny variant of Unix written by Andrew 
        Tannenbaum.  He thought it had too many deficiencies, so he wrote his own kernel.  


    - For the latest release of the Linux kernel (4.17, June 2018), over 1700 developers have made 13,500
        changes to the kernel alone.



- The Linux Truth

    - Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from 
        doing clever things.


    - The root user can do anything on a Linux machine.  There are no limits of any type on the root user.


    - Non-root users have a few limits placed on them, but they can still do many clever things as well.  
        The primary limits placed on non-root users are intended to prevent them from doing things that 
        interfere with others' ability to freely use the Linux host.  This does not prevent users from 
        doing great harm to their own user accounts.



- Understanding Linux

    1. Knowledge
         Since Linux is open, we can learn how things work, which helps in learning how to solve problems.

    2. Flexibility
         Linux can run on a huge number of different hardware platforms.  Intel and AMD, Raspberry Pi,
           Tv, cell phones, DVRs, the ISS, and the top 500 fastest supercomputers are examples.

    3. Stability
         Linux machines can run uninteruppted for long periods of time.
         
    4. Scalability
         Linux can run on watches and phones, workstations, servers, and supercomputers.  It runs the
           smallest and largest computers, and everything in between.

    5. Security
         Linux was designed with security measures from the ground up.

    6. Freedom
         We have access to the source code and can change or recompile it.

    7. Longevity
         Linux prevents planned obselescence of hardware by keeping resource use low.  Resistance to 
           malware also helps with this.
