CHAPTER 3 - THE LINUX PHILOSOPHY FOR SYSADMINS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Structure of the Philosophy

    1. Foundational Tenets
         Basic commands and low-level knowledge

    2. Functional Tenets
         Build on the foundation and perform daily sysadmin tasks

    3. Enlightenment
         Deep understanding and knowledge sharing



- Tenets

    1. Data Streams are a Universal Interface

         - Everything in Linux revolves around streams of data - particulary text streams.  A stream is 
             a flow of text data that originates at some source.

         - STDIO provides a standardized interface for passing data.  It is a buffered data stream used
             to stream the output of one program/file/device to the input of another.


    2. Transforming Data Streams

         - Data streams can be manipulated by inserting transformers into the stream using pipes.  These
             transformers are sometimes also called 'filters'.

         - Redirection can then be used at the end of the pipeline to direct the data stream to a file.


    3. Everything is a File

         - Everything can be the source of a data stream, the target of a data stream , or in many cases
             both.

         - For instance, this makes it possible to copy a boot record, a disk partition, or an entire
             hard drive.

         - All devices are implemented as special files located in the /dev directory.  Device files are
             not device drivers.  They are gateways that are exposed to the user.


    4. Use the Linux FHS

         - The Linux File Hierarchy Standard defines the structure of the Linux directory tree.  It names
             a set of standard directories and designates their purposes.  This standard ensures that all
             distros are consistent in their usage.


    5. Embrace the CLI

         - The command line provides the primary interface to the OS.


    6. Be the Lazy Sysadmin

         - If you are efficient, you can be a lazy admin, but also a very productive admin.


    7. Automate Everything

         - We should be thinking about automating every single task, whether it runs once an hour or once
             a year.


    8. Always Use Shell Scripts

         - Shell scripts are portable and easily read and written.


    9. Test Early, Test Often

         - Testing requires a well-designed test plan based on requirements statements.  The plan should
             verify that the code does everything it is supposed to do.


    10. Use Common Sense Naming

         - If possible, keep names lowercase and short.  On the other hand, they must be long enough
             to be distinguishable.


    11. Store Data in Open Formats

         - Using well-known open formats is better.  Using plain text is best.


    12. Use Seprate Filesystems for Naming

         - There are at least 3 excellent reasons for maintaining separate filesystems (partitions) 
             on Linux hosts:

             1. If a hard drive crashes, other filesystems on the drive may still salvagable.
             2. It's possible to fill up a filesystem, and multiple filesystems makes handling this easier.
             3. Upgrages can be made easier if some directories are duplicated.


    13. Make Programs Portable

         - Use a scripting langauge rather than a compiled one.


    14. Use Open Source Software

         - Use code we are free to inspect, modify, and enhance.


    15. Strive For Elegance

         - Elegant solutions produce elegant results and are easy to maintain and fix.


    16. Find the Simplicity

         - Think about solving only the task at hand and nothing else.


    17. Use Your Favorite Editor

         - vi is useful, since it is nearly always present on Linux systems.


    18. Document Everything

         - Good documentation is not easy and it takes time.  It requires an understanding of the
             audience.  It is extremely valuable when written well.


    19. Back Up Everything - Frequently

         - Backups save time, effort, and money.  Don't be caught without them.


    20. Follow Your Curiosity

         - Always keep learning new things.  Follow wherever your curiosity leads you.


    21. There is No Should

         - There may always be exceptions to any of these rules.  Linux is flexible, so you can solve the
             problem the best way for your needs.


    22. Mentor the Young Sysadmins

         - Include other people when solving problems so that knowledge is passed on.


    23. Support Your Favorite Open Source Project

         - Answer questions on forums, contribute bug reports, write documentation, write code, teach,
             or contribute money.


    24. Reality Bytes

         - In reality, you will end up having to compromise these principles in some high-pressure
             situation.
