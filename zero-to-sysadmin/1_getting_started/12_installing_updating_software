- Dependency Hell

    - Dependency hell is the difficult process of resolving multiple layers of complex
        dependencies.  It was a common problem before the development of moder package
        managers.



- RPM

    - RPM (RPM Package Manager) is a program and system that provides the capabilites 
        to install, upgrade, remove and manage RPM packages.  It is the original Red Hat
        package manager.  RPM packages have the .rpm file extension.


    - RPM is a little primitive compared to more recent package managers, but it was a
        big step forward at the time (1997).  It can only manage packages that are already
        on the local machine and has some trouble with advanced dependency resolution.


    - Before RPM, the old process took time and patience:

        1. Download the source code (usually distributed as tarballs)
        2. Untar the tarball to the desired location
        3. Run 'make configure' to configure the procedure for the specific host
        4. Run 'make' to to perform the actual compilation of the source to executable files
        5. Run 'make install' to install the executable binary file and any libraries created


    - To use rpm:

        # Download RPM package
        $ su -
        $ cd /tmp
        $ wget https://github.com/Apress/linux-volume-1/blob/master/utils-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm

        # Try to install package, fails because dependencies are missing
        $ rpm -ivf utils-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm

        # Install package with dependencies
        $ rpm -qR utils-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm



- YUM

    - YUM (Yellow Dog Updater Modified) was an early (2001) attempt to address RPM's 
        shortcomings.  It resolved dependencies and was able to download packages from 
        the internet.  It was very successful at its time, but had several problems
        that were uncovered over time.


    - YUM and DNF have the exact same syntax.  In fact, if you run 'yum' now, it is just an
        alias to 'dnf'.

        $ for I in `which yum dnf` ; do ll $I ; done
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 5 Dec 13 05:33 /usr/bin/yum -> dnf-3
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 5 Dec 13 05:33 /usr/bin/dnf -> dnf-3



- DNF

    - DNF (Dandified YUM) replaced YUM as the default package manager in 2015.  It is a
        wrapper around RPM.


    - It determines all dependencies recursively, identifies all the packages required,
        then continues to recurse until no further dependencies are found.


    - DNF can automatically download GPG signing keys and check RPM packages for authenticity
        before they are installed.
