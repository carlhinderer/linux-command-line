CHAPTER 4 - PREPARATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Installing VirtualBox

    - We will be using the latest version of Fedora for our VMs.  Find instructions specific to your 
        OS for installing VirtualBox.



- Configuring the Virtual Network

    - A virtual network is a private network that exists only on the VirtualBox host.  It is designed to 
        allow the user to manage access to the outside world.

    - The virtual router which is created also provides services such as DHCP and name services for the
        VMs on the virtual network.

    - The 'NAT' option is the default, and simplest option for VMS.  It allows VMs to talk to the internet,
        but not to each other.  Since we need them to talk to each other, we'll use the 'NAT Network'
        option that allows them to talk to each other and the internet.


    - To create a virtual NAT Network:

        > File > Preferences
        > Network
        
        > Add New NAT Network
            Network Name: StudentNetwork



- Preparing Disk Space

    - To attach a USB hard drive:

        1. Check the current partitions

            $ df -h


        2. Plug the drive into the USB


        3. Find the drive ID assigned to the new device

            # sdb is the new drive
            $ dmesg

            ...
            [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk


        4. See if there are existing partitions on the disk

            $ fdisk /dev/sdb


           Then, use fdisk to delete the existing partitions and create a new partition.

            Command: d   # Delete existing partitions
            Command: n   # Create new partition

            Command: p   # Print current partition table and disk information
            Command: w   # Write revised partition table to disk



        5. Create an EXT4 filesystem on the new partition.

            $ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdi1


        6. Add a label to the new partition.

            # Add label
            $ e2label /dev/sdi1 Experiments

            # See labels
            $ e2label /dev/sdi1


        7. Create the 'Experiments' directory.  This will be the directory on which we mount the
             filesystem we are creating on the USB drive.

            # Add in root directory
            $ mkdir /Experiments


        8. At this point, we could mount the USB filesystem, but we'll make it easier by adding a 
             line to the 'etc/fstab' (filesystem table) file.

            $ echo "LABEL=Experiments /Experiments ext4 user,owner,noauto,defaults  0 0" >> /etc/fstab


        9. Now, we mount the drive and verify that it is present.

            $ mount /Experiments
            $ df -h


        10. Now, we can look at the contents in our new directory.

            $ ll -a /Experiments

            total 24
            drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Aug  8 09:34 .
            dr-xr-xr-x. 24 root root  4096 Aug  8 11:18 ..
            drwx------   2 root root 16384 Aug  8 09:34 lost+found


        11. Change the group ownerships and permissions of the directory so that VirtualBox users can 
              have access to it.

            # Change permissions
            $ cd /
            $ chgrp root /Experiments
            $ chmod g+w /Experiments


            # See Experiments directory
            $ ll | grep Exp

            drwxrwxr-x    3 root root  4096 


        12. Finally, we need to add our own non-root user account to the vboxusers group in the 
              /etc/groups file.

            # Find vboxusers group
            $ cd /etc
            $ grep vboxusers group

            vboxusers:x:973:


            # Add user to group
            $ usermod -G vboxusers myusername
            $ grep vboxusers group

            vboxusers:x:973:dboth


            # Not in book, but I needed to 777 /Experiments to get things working
            $ chmod 777 /Experiments



- Download the Fedora ISO File

    - Download the Fedora XFCE live boot image:
        https://spins.fedoraproject.org/xfce/download/index.html


    - Move the file:

        $ cd ~/Downloads
        $ mv Fedora* /tmp



- Creating the VM
