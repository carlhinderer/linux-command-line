- CLI Terminology

    - The 'command prompt' is the prompt to enter a command:

         [student@studentvm1 ~]$


    - The 'command line' is the line on the terminal that contains the command prompt and
        any command you enter.  The command line can be accessed through a graphical 
        terminal emulator, through a virtual console (with KVM aka Keyboard-Video-Mouse 
        support), or via remote login (like SSH).


    - The 'command-line interface' is any text mode user interface to the Linux OS that
        allows the user to type commands and read responses.


    - Commands are typed on the command line to tell Linux what to do:

        command [-o(ptions)] [arg1] [arg2] ... [argX]


    - Originally, a 'terminal' was a piece of hardware that provides a means of
        interacting with a mainframe or Unix host.  

      Terminals that are even older, such as mechanical teletype machines (TTY), predate
        the use of CRT displays.  Often, these 'dumb terminals' were connected to mainframes
        over telephone lines, and had just enough logic to display data from the host and
        transfer data to the host.

      Much of the terminology pertaining to the command line is rooted in these dumb
        terminals.  For instance, if you look in the /dev folder of your Linux machine, you'll
        see lots of TTY device files.


    - A 'console' is a special terminal, since it is the primary terminal connected to the host
        itself.  Many restricted commands could only be run from the console.  For instance, only
        the console could display system-level error messages when problems occurred.  


    - Modern Linux computers provide the capability for 'virtual consoles' that allow for 
        multiple logins from a single keyboard and monitor.  Each virtual console is assigned
        a function key corresponding to the console number (usually Cntl+Alt+F1 etc).


    - A 'terminal emulator' is a software program that emulates a hardware terminal.  Xterm (1984)
        was the first terminal emulator.  Popular terminal emulators today include GNOME-terminal,
        Tilix, Terminator, and Konsole.  


    - In Linux, almost everything is handled as a file.  Device files (aka 'device special files')
        are used to provide the OS and user an interface to the devices they represent.  All 
        Linux device files are located in the /dev directory.

      A 'pseudo-terminal' is a device file to which a terminal emulator is attached in order to 
        interface with the OS.  The device files for the pseudo-terminals are located in the
        /dev/pts directory and are created only when a new terminal emulator is launched.


    - A 'session' refers to a terminal session, which is a single terminal emulator connected
        to a single user login and shell.


    - A 'shell' is the command interpreter for the OS.  The most popular shells are:

        1. bash = most popular, based on bourne shell
        2. csh  = for people who like C syntax
        3. ksh  = korn shell, popular with Unix users
        4. tcsh = version of csh that is easier to use
        5. zsh  = combines many features of other popular shells


    - SSH is not really a shell.  The 'ssh' command starts a secure link between itself as the
        client and another server running the SSHD server.


    - A 'screen session' is useful, because it will continue to run applications even if a 
        connection is broken due to a network interruption.
