CHAPTER 14 - TERMINAL EMULATOR MANIA
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Requirements

    - We first install all of the terminal emulators we will look at:

        # Install terminal emulators
        $ dnf -y install tilix lxterminal konsole5 rxvt terminator



- RXVT

    - RXVT is a very minimalist terminal.  It doesn't have multiple tabs or pains, it's
        font support is primitive, and it has no menu or icon bars.



- Xfce4-Terminal

    - The Xfce4-Terminal is powerful yet simple.  It allows multiple tabs, and each tab
        can be logged in as a separate user.

    - To customize the terminal's look and feel, navigate to 
        Edit > Preferences > Appearance.



- LXTerminal

    - LXTerminal has some simple features, including tabs.  However, it uses a very small
        amount of RAM and has a very small executable file.

    - To access the terminal's minimal configuration options, navigate to
        Edit > Preferences > Display.



- Tilix

    - Tilix allows us to keep a very large number of terminal sessions in a single
        window, with a lot of flexibility about they are displayed.  This can be useful
        when monitoring multiple hosts at the same time, for instance.

    - Buttons on the Tilix menu bar will open a new terminal to the side or below of an 
        existing terminal.  We can also create multiple 'sessions' that we can toggle
        back and forth between, each with their own set of terminals.

    - There are other popular options for managing multiple terminal sessions in a 
        single window.  The GNU 'screen' utility and 'tmux' are 2 of the most commonly 
        used.



- Konsole

    - Konsole is the default emulator for the KDE desktop environment.  It has lots of
        features, but installs a lot of KDE libraries so is rarely used outside of KDE.



- Terminator

    - Terminator is another powerful and feature-rich terminal emulator.  It is based
        on GNOME-terminal.
