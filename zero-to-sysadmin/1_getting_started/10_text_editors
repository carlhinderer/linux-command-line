- Learning Vim

    - Vim has an excellent tutorial, 'vimtutor', which is a great way to learn it.  It
        is included in the 'vim-enhanced' package.

        # Install the vim-enhanced package (as root)
        $ dnf -y install vim-enhanced

        # Start the tutorial
        $ vimtutor



- Vim Example - Disabling SELinux

    - SELinux is a security protocol originally created by the NSA to prevent hackers
        from making changes to a Linux machine even if they gain access.  Since it makes
        the experiments in this book harder, we'll disable it.

        $ vim /etc/selinux/config

        # Update setting
        SELINUX=disabled

        # Must reboot after making change
