CHAPTER 16 - LINUX BOOT & STARTUP
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Boot and Startup Process

    - There are 3 parts to the complete boot and startup process:

        1. Hardware boot (which initializes the system hardware)
        2. Linux boot (which loads the Linux kernel and systemd)
        3. Linux startup (in which systemd makes the host ready for productive work)



- Hardware Boot

    - The hardware boot process is the same for any Intel-based OS:

        1. When power is first applied to the computer, it runs the POST (Power On Self
             Test), which is part of BIOS (Basic Input Output System) or the newer UEFI
             (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).

           If POST fails, the computer may not be usable, so the boot process does not
             continue.


        2. Once POST has checked basic operability of the hardware, it locates the boot
             sectors on all attached bootable devices, including hard drives, DVDs/CDs,
             or bootable USB sticks.  

           The first boot sector it finds that contains a valid MBR is loaded into RAM,
             and control is then transferred to the RAM copy of the boot sector.


    - The BIOS/UEFI interface can be used to configure the system hardware for things
        like overclocking, specifying CPU cores as active or inactive, and specifying 
        devices from which the system can boot and their sequence.


    - It is convenient to make the USB drive the first boot device, since this allows
        inserting a live boot USB if needed for troubleshooting.  However, in most
        commercial environments it is more secure to allow boot from an internal drive
        only.



- Linux Boot

    - GRUB

        - GRUB2 (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the newest version of the GRUB bootloader 
            and is the standard bootloader for most common.  GRUB is the program that
            makes the computer just smart enough to find the OS kernel and load it into
            memory.

        - GRUB has been designed to be compatible with the multiboot specification, 
            which allows it to boot many versions of Linux and other free OS's.

        - GRUB can allow the user to choose to boot from among several different kernels
            for your distro if more than one is present due to system updates.

        - GRUB can be configured using the /boot/grub/grub.conf file.
