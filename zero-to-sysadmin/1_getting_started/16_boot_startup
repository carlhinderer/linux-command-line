CHAPTER 16 - LINUX BOOT & STARTUP
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Boot and Startup Process

    - There are 3 parts to the complete boot and startup process:

        1. Hardware boot (which initializes the system hardware)
        2. Linux boot (which loads the Linux kernel and systemd)
        3. Linux startup (in which systemd makes the host ready for productive work)



- Hardware Boot

    - The hardware boot process is the same for any Intel-based OS:

        1. When power is first applied to the computer, it runs the POST (Power On Self
             Test), which is part of BIOS (Basic Input Output System) or the newer UEFI
             (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).

           If POST fails, the computer may not be usable, so the boot process does not
             continue.


        2. Once POST has checked basic operability of the hardware, it locates the boot
             sectors on all attached bootable devices, including hard drives, DVDs/CDs,
             or bootable USB sticks.  

           The first boot sector it finds that contains a valid MBR is loaded into RAM,
             and control is then transferred to the RAM copy of the boot sector.


    - The BIOS/UEFI interface can be used to configure the system hardware for things
        like overclocking, specifying CPU cores as active or inactive, and specifying 
        devices from which the system can boot and their sequence.


    - It is convenient to make the USB drive the first boot device, since this allows
        inserting a live boot USB if needed for troubleshooting.  However, in most
        commercial environments it is more secure to allow boot from an internal drive
        only.



- Linux Boot

    - GRUB

        - GRUB2 (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the newest version of the GRUB bootloader 
            and is the standard bootloader for most common.  GRUB is the program that
            makes the computer just smart enough to find the OS kernel and load it into
            memory.

        - GRUB has been designed to be compatible with the multiboot specification, 
            which allows it to boot many versions of Linux and other free OS's.

        - GRUB can allow the user to choose to boot from among several different kernels
            for your distro if more than one is present due to system updates.

        - GRUB can be configured using the /boot/grub/grub.conf file.



- GRUB stage 1

    - After the BIOS/UEFI POST, BIOS/UEFI searches the attached disks for a boot
        record, which is located in the MBR (Master Boot Record).  It loads the
        first one it finds into memory and then starts execution of the boot record.


    - The bootstrap code (GRUB Stage 1) is very small, since it must fit into the
        first 512-byte sector on the hard drive along with the partition table.  

      The total amount of space allocated for a classic, generic MBR is 446 bytes.  This
        file is named 'boot.img', and does not contain the partition table.  The
        partition table is created when the device is partitioned onto the boot record
        starting at byte 447.


    - In UEFI systems, the partition table has been moved out of the MBR and into the
        space immediately following the MBR.  This provides more space for defining 
        partitions, so a larger number of partitions can be created.


    - Because the boot record must be so small, it is not smart and does not understand
        filesystem structures like ext4.  It's sole purpose is to load GRUB stage 1.5.  

      In order to accomplish this, stage 1.5 must be located in the space between the
        partition table and the first partition on the drive.


    - To view the boot partition:

        # List disk drives
        $ lsblk -i
        NAME                       MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
        sda                          8:0    0   60G  0 disk
        |-sda1                       8:1    0    1G  0 part /boot
        `-sda2                       8:2    0   59G  0 part
        ...

        # Examine the boot record of the boot drive
        $ dd if =/dev/sda bs=512 count=1


    - Note that the output is unreadable, since it is in a binary format.  For a
        different view of the boot record, we can use the 'od' command to display  
        the data in octal instead, with the '-a' option to try and convert the
        octal values to ASCII characters when possible.

        # Display boot record in octal
        $ dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | od -a -


    - There is a generic boot record without a partition table in the /boot directory.
        We can look at it to see the boot record by itself.

        # Display the generic boot record
        $ od -a /boot/grub2/i386-pc/boot.img

        # The 'strings' command will output only the ASCII characters in the record
        $ strings /boot/grub2/i386-pc/boot.img



- GRUB stage 1.5

    - GRUB stage 1.5 must be located in the space between the partition table and the
        first partition on the hard drive.  This space was left unused historically for
        compatibility reasons, and is sometimes called the 'boot track' or 'MBR gap'.

      The first partition on our hard drive begins at sector 63, and with the MBR in 
        sector 0, that leaves 62 512-byte sectors in which to store stage 1.5.


    - To look at GRUB stage 1.5:

        # Look at the first sector of stage 1.5
        $ dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 skip=1 | od -a -


    - Because of the larger amount of space available for stage 1.5, it can have enough
        code to include a few common filesystem drivers (like EXT, XFS, FAT, and NTFS).


    - Note that the /boot directory must be located on a filesystem that is supported by
        GRUB such as EXT4.



- GRUB stage 2

    - All of the files for GRUB stage 2 are located in the /boot/grub2 directory and its
        subdirectories.  GRUB2 does not have an image file like stages 1 and 1.5. 

      Instead, stage 2 consists of the files and runtime kernel modules that are loaded as
        needed from the /boot/grub2 directory and its subdirectories.


    - The function of GRUB stage 2 is to locate and load a Linux kernel into RAM and turn
        control over to the kernel.  

      The kernel and its associated files are located in the /boot directory.  The kernel
        files are all named starting with 'vmlinuz'.

        # List currently installed kernels
        $ ll /boot
 
      The 'System.map' files are symbol tables that map the physical addresses of the symbols
        such as variables and functions.  The 'initramfs' files are used early in the Linux
        boot process before the filesystem drivers have been loaded and the filesystems
        mounted.



- Configuring GRUB

    - GRUB is configured with /boot/grub2/grub.cfg, but we do not change the file because
        it can be overwritten when the kernel is updated to a new version.  Instead, we
        make modifications to the /etc/default/grub file.

        # Look at unmodified version of the /etc/default/grub file:
        $ cd /etc/default ; cat grub

        GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
        GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
        GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
        GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
        GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=/dev/mapper/fedora_studentvm1-swap
                            rd.lvm.lv=fedora_studentvm1/root
                            rd.lvm.lv=fedora_studentvm1/swap
                            rd.lvm.lv=fedora_studentvm1/usr rhgb quiet"
        GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"


    - The options:

        GRUB_TIMEOUT
          Amount of seconds for the GRUB menu countdown

        GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY
          Toggles whether the GRUB rescue option is available

        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
          List of arguments passed to the kernel at boot time


    - Once we have updated the grub config file, we need to run the 'grub2-mkconfig'
        command to reflect the updates.

        # Update the grub config
        $ grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
