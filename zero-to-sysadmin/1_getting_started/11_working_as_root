CHAPTER 11 - WORKING AS ROOT
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Why root?

    - The root user can do anything on a Linux computer.  They can perform any task, 
        regardless of which user owns a file, directory, or process.  They can delete
        undeletable files and add and delete users.  They can kill, suspend, or change
        the priority of any running process.

    - Non-root users do not have the authority to perform root-level tasks on a Linux
        computer.  For example, they may not enter directories that belong to other
        users.  

    - Although it is possible for the user of a non-root account to have root privileges,
        it is not a best practice to do so.  If a few users need access to a few
        commands that require root privilege, the sudo facitlity should be used to give
        them access to only those commands.



- The su Command

    - The su command (aka 'switch user' or 'substitute user') allows us to work on the 
        command line as a different user from the one we logged in as.  Each SysAdmin
        should have a non-root account, and switch to the root user only when 
        root privileges are required.


    - If we switch to root and don't use the hyphen with the command, the environment,
        $PATH, and other environment variables including the $PWD will remain that of
        the previous user.  This is for historical backwards compatibility reasons.

      If we add the hyphen, it tells the su command to start up a new login shell, which
        sets the root environment and makes /root the $PWD.  If we're switching to a user
        other than root, it will set the environment for that user.


    - The root user can 'su' to any other user's account without needing their password.



- Getting to Know the root Account

    - Each Linux user account has attributes which provide the OS with information about
        how to handle the account, files belonging to the account, and any commands
        entered on behalf of the account.  These include the user id (UID) and group id
        (GID).


    - Here, we determine the UID and GID of the root account:

        # Switch to root
        $ su -

        # Get the UID and GID of the root user
        $ id
        uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

        # Files in home directory, with user name (root) and group name (root)
        $ ll
        -rw-------. 1 root root 1354 Aug 13 16:24 anaconda-ks.cfg
        -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1371 Aug 18 10:16 initial-setup-ks.cfg

        # Files in home directory, with UID (0) and GID (0) instead
        $ ll -n
        -rw-------. 1 0 0 1354 Aug 13 16:24 anaconda-ks.cfg
        -rw-r--r--. 1 0 0 1371 Aug 18 10:16 initial-setup-ks.cfg


    - A non-root user cannot create new directories in most parts of the directory tree.  
        They can create new directories in 2 places:

          1. Their home directory
          2. The /tmp directory


    - To explain why non-root users cannot create new files or directories, we can look at
        the ownerships and permissions of the root directory:

        [student@studentvm1 ~]$ ls -la /
        total 76
        dr-xr-xr-x.  18 root root  4096 Apr 25 02:19 .
        dr-xr-xr-x.  18 root root  4096 Apr 25 02:19 ..
        <snip>
        dr-xr-xr-x.  13 root root     0 Sep 12 17:18 sys
        drwxrwxrwt.  10 root root  4096 Sep 13 16:45 tmp
        drwxr-xr-x.  13 root root  4096 Apr 25 02:19 usr
        drwxr-xr-x.  22 root root  4096 Apr 25 02:23 var


      This is the structure of Linux permissions for files and directories:

        Directory    User    Group    Other
        d or -       rwx     rwx      rwx


      The User is the owner of the directory.
