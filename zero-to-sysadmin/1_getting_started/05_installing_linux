CHAPTER 5 - INSTALLING LINUX
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Booting the Fedora Live Image

    - To boot the Fedora Live Image, go to the VM's settings:

        > Controller: IDE
            > CD: Fedora.iso


    - Initial Logins:

        u: Live System user
        p: (none)



- Installing Fedora

    1. Start the Installation

         - First, click the 'Install to Hard Drive' link on the desktop.


    2. Set the Hostname

        - On installation screen, navigate to 'Network and Host Name'

            Host Name: studentvm1


    3. Hard Drive Partitioning

         - We also need to partition the hard drive in a more standard, recommended manner.  
             To do this, we click 'Installation Destination'.

             Storage Configuration: Custom


         - We need to create a partitioning scheme like this one:

              Mount point       Partition       Filesystem type        Size (GiB)        Label
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              /boot             Standard        EXT4                   1.0               boot

              / (root)          LVM             EXT4                   2.0               root

              /usr              LVM             EXT4                   15.0              usr

              /home             LVM             EXT4                   2.0               home

              /var              LVM             EXT4                   10.0              var

              /tmp              LVM             EXT4                   5.0               tmp

              swap              swap            swap                   4.0               swap
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Total                                                    39.00


         - To add each of these partitions:

             > Click the '+' button
             > Add the Mount Point and Size


         - Some terminology:

             1. The entire Linux directory structure, starting with the root (/) directory,
                  is the 'Linux filesystem'.

             2. A raw partition can be formatted with an EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS, or other
                  filesystem metastructure.  The partition can then be called a 'filesystem.'

             3. If the partition is for the '/home' directory, for example, it will be called
                  the '/home filesystem'.  The /home filesystem is then mounted on the 
                  '/home' mount point, and then it becomes a logical and functional part
                  of the root filesystem.


         - After all the partitions are defined, the Anaconda installer will create the volume
             group, the logical volumes, any raw partitions such as '/boot', and the entire
             directory including mount points on the / filesystem.

           It will format the volumes or partitions with the selected filesystem type (usually
             ext4) and create the '/etc/fstab' file to define the mounts and their mount points,
             so that the kernel can find them each time the system is booted.


         - The /boot partition contains the files required for the system to boot up and
             gain a minimal state of functionality.  Because full-featured filesystem 
             kernel drivers are not available at this boint, the /boot partition must be a
             standard non-LVM Linux partition within an ext4 filesystem.

             > Add a New Mount Point
                 > Mount Point: /boot
                 > Desired Capacity: 1G
                 > Label: boot
                 > Click 'Update Settings'


         - After saving the updated settings for the /boot filesystem, the rest of the 
             partitions can be created as logical volumes in a volume group.

           LVM (Logical Volume Management) makes managing and resizing logical volumes
             very easy.

           Create the root:

               > Add a New Mount Point
                 > Mount Point: /
                 > Desired Capacity: 2G
                 > Label: root
                 > Click 'Update Settings'

           Now, the device is 'LVM', and there is a volume group name.


         - In order to include all the remaining space on our virtual hard drive in the volume
             group:

               > Click 'Modify' under 'Volume Group'
                 > Size Policy: As large as possible


         - Now, we can add the other partitions, except for the swap partition.
