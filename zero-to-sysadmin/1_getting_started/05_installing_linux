CHAPTER 5 - INSTALLING LINUX
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Booting the Fedora Live Image

    - To boot the Fedora Live Image, go to the VM's settings:

        > Controller: IDE
            > CD: Fedora.iso


    - Initial Logins:

        u: Live System user
        p: (none)



- Installing Fedora

    1. Start the Installation

         - First, click the 'Install to Hard Drive' link on the desktop.


    2. Set the Hostname

        - On installation screen, navigate to 'Network and Host Name'

            Host Name: studentvm1


    3. Hard Drive Partitioning

         - We also need to partition the hard drive in a more standard, recommended manner.  
             To do this, we click 'Installation Destination'.

             Storage Configuration: Custom


         - We need to create a partitioning scheme like this one:

              Mount point       Partition       Filesystem type        Size (GiB)        Label
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              /boot             Standard        EXT4                   1.0               boot

              / (root)          LVM             EXT4                   2.0               root

              /usr              LVM             EXT4                   15.0              usr

              /home             LVM             EXT4                   2.0               home

              /var              LVM             EXT4                   10.0              var

              /tmp              LVM             EXT4                   5.0               tmp

              swap              swap            swap                   4.0               swap
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Total                                                    39.00


         - To add each of these partitions:

             > Click the '+' button
             > Add the Mount Point and Size


         - Some terminology:

             1. The entire Linux directory structure, starting with the root (/) directory,
                  is the 'Linux filesystem'.

             2. A raw partition can be formatted with an EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS, or other
                  filesystem metastructure.  The partition can then be called a 'filesystem.'

             3. If the partition is for the '/home' directory, for example, it will be called
                  the '/home filesystem'.  The /home filesystem is then mounted on the 
                  '/home' mount point, and then it becomes a logical and functional part
                  of the root filesystem.


         - After all the partitions are defined, the Anaconda installer will create the volume
             group, the logical volumes, any raw partitions such as '/boot', and the entire
             directory including mount points on the / filesystem.

           It will format the volumes or partitions with the selected filesystem type (usually
             ext4) and create the '/etc/fstab' file to define the mounts and their mount points,
             so that the kernel can find them each time the system is booted.


         - The /boot partition contains the files required for the system to boot up and
             gain a minimal state of functionality.  Because full-featured filesystem 
             kernel drivers are not available at this boint, the /boot partition must be a
             standard non-LVM Linux partition within an ext4 filesystem.

             > Add a New Mount Point
                 > Mount Point: /boot
                 > Desired Capacity: 1G
                 > Label: boot
                 > Click 'Update Settings'


         - After saving the updated settings for the /boot filesystem, the rest of the 
             partitions can be created as logical volumes in a volume group.

           LVM (Logical Volume Management) makes managing and resizing logical volumes
             very easy.

           Create the root:

               > Add a New Mount Point
                 > Mount Point: /
                 > Desired Capacity: 2G
                 > Label: root
                 > Click 'Update Settings'

           Now, the device is 'LVM', and there is a volume group name.


         - In order to include all the remaining space on our virtual hard drive in the volume
             group:

               > Click 'Modify' under 'Volume Group'
                 > Size Policy: As large as possible


         - Now, we can add the other partitions, except for the swap partition.



- About Swap Space

    - Swap (aka paging) is used to substitute disk space for RAM when RAM fills up.  
        The kernel uses a memory management program the detects blocks (aka pages) of
        memory which haven't been used recently, and moves them over to a special partition
        on the hard drive.

    - The total amount of memory in a Linux computer is the RAM plus swap space, and is 
        referred to as virtual memory.

    - Linux provides for 2 types of swap space, 'swap partitions' and 'swap files'.  A swap
        file can be used when there is no free disk space in which to create a swap partition.
        The 'mkswap' command is used to designate a partition or file as swap space.

    - Thrashing can occur when the total virtual memory becomes nearly full.  It can cause the
        system to become completely unresponsive or very slow.  The 'free' command will show
        CPU and memory usage, and can be used to diagnose this problem.



- Recommended Amount of Swap Space

    Amount of RAM installed in system         Recommended swap space
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ≤ 2GB                                     2X RAM

    2GB–8GB                                   = RAM

    >8GB                                      8GB


    - Now, we can create the swap partition.  The swap partition does not have a mount point,
        as it's only available to the kernel.
