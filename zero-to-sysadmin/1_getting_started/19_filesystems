CHAPTER 19 - FILESYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Definitions

    - There are several different meanings of the word 'filesystem':

        1. A specific type of data storate format, like EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, or XFS.
             Linux supports almost 100 types of filesystems.  Each uses its own metadata
             structures.

        2. The entire Linux hierarchical directory structure starting at the / root 
             directory.

        3. A partition or logical volume formatted with a specific type of filesystem that
             can be mounted on a specified mount point on a Linux filesystem.



- Filesystem Functions

    1. Data storage = A structured place to store and retrieve data (primary purpose)

    2. Namespace = A naming and organizational methodology that provides rules for naming
                     and structuring data

    3. Security Model = A scheme for defining access rights

    4. API = System function calls to manipulate filesystem objects like directories and files

    5. Implementation = The software to implement the above functions



- The Linux Filesystem Hierarchical Standard

    - The Standard

        - The Linux directory structure is well-defined and documented in the Linux FHS
            (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard).   


            /
            Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.

            /bin
            Essential command binaries that need to be available in single user mode; for 
              all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.

            /boot
            Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.

            /dev
            Device files, e.g., /dev/null, /dev/disk0, /dev/sda1, /dev/tty, /dev/random.

            /etc
            Host-specific system-wide configuration files

            /etc/opt
            Configuration files for add-on packages that are stored in /opt.

            /etc/sgml
            Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes SGML.

            /etc/X11
            Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11.

            /etc/xml
            Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes XML.

            /home
            Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

            /lib 
            Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.

            /lib<qual>
            Alternative format essential libraries. Such directories are optional, but if 
              they exist, they have some requirements.

            /media
            Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).

            /mnt
            Temporarily mounted filesystems.

            /opt
            Optional application software packages.

            /proc
            Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, 
              corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated 
              by the system, on the fly.

            /root
            Home directory for the root user.

            /run
            Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., 
              currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files under this directory must 
              be either removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process; but this is 
              not necessary on systems that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs).

            /sbin
            Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.

            /srv
            Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data 
              offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems 
              (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).

            /sys
            Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.

            /tmp
            Temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots, and may 
              be severely size restricted.

            /usr
            Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user 
              utilities and applications.

            /usr/bin
            Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single user mode); for all users.

            /usr/include
            Standard include files.

            /usr/lib
            Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

            /usr/lib<qual>
            Alternative format libraries, e.g. /usr/lib32 for 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit 
              machine (optional).

            /usr/local
            Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further 
              subdirectories, e.g., bin, lib, share.

            /usr/sbin
            Non-essential system binaries, e.g., daemons for various network-services.

            /usr/share
            Architecture-independent (shared) data.

            /usr/src
            Source code, e.g., the kernel source code with its header files.

            /usr/X11R6
            X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional).

            /var
            Variable files—files whose content is expected to continually change during normal 
              operation of the system—such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.

            /var/cache
            Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming 
              I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. 
              The cached files can be deleted without loss of data.

            /var/lib
            State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run, e.g., databases, 
              packaging system metadata, etc.

            /var/lock
            Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use.

            /var/log
            Log files. Various logs.

            /var/mail
            Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated 
              /var/spool/mail.

            /var/opt
            Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.

            /var/run
            Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing 
              the system since it was booted.  In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system 
              should either continue to provide a /var/run directory, or provide a symbolic link 
              from /var/run to /run, for backwards compatibility.

            /var/spool
            Spool for tasks waiting to be processed, e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue.

            /var/spool/mail
            Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.

            /var/tmp
            Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.
