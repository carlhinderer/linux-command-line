CHAPTER 6 - USING THE XFCE DESKTOP
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Why Xfce?

    - Xfce is a more lightweight alternative to the more popular GNOME and KDE desktops.
        This makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments like VMs.  

    - Thunar is the default file manager for Xfce.  It is a lightweight alternative to
        more fully-featured file managers like Konqueror and Dolphin.  

    - The Xfce4-terminal emulator is a lightweight alternative to more fully-featured
        emulators like Tilix, Terminator, and Konsole.



- Getting Started

        # Switch to root account
        $ su -

        # Install all available updates
        $ dnf -y update

        # Reboot so that the new kernel is loaded
        $ reboot

        # After reboot, update man pages
        $ mandb
