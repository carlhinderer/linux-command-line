CHAPTER 17 - SHELL CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Staring the Shell

    - When a shell is started, a sequence of events takes place, first with global
        config files, then with local config files that allow users to override
        global settings.


    - A 'login shell' is one in which you need to use a user id and password to gain
        access.  This is the case with a virtual console, an SSH session, or a GUI
        desktop.

      A 'non-login shell' is one that is spawned or launched within another, 
        already-running shell.  Non-login shells can be launched from within the GUI
        desktop by the 'screen' command or within a terminal emulator with multiple
        tabs.


    - There are 5 main files and one directory that are used to configure the bash 
        environment.  

        1. /etc/profile
             System-wide environment and startup programs

        2. /etd/bashrc
             System-wide functions and aliases

        3. /etc/profile.d
             This directory contains system-wide scripts for configuring various CLI
               tools such as vim and mc.  The SysAdmin can also place custom config
               scripts in this directory.

        4. ~/.bash_profile
             User-specific environment and startup programs

        5. ~/.bashrc
             User-specific aliases and functions

        6. ~/.bash_logout
             User-specific commands to execute when the user logs out


    - All user shell config files are located in the /etc/skel directory, and are copied
        into the home directory when a new account is created.



- Non-Login Shell Startup

    1. The shell is started.

    2. We execute ~/.bashrc which calls /etc.bashrc

    3. The /etc.bashrc program contains code that calls each of the files ending with 
         '*.sh' and the file 'sh.local' that are located in /etc/profile.d.

    4. After this, control is returned to ~/.bashrc, which performs any extra actions
         and exits.



- Login Shell Startup

    1. The shell is started.

    2. The /etc/profile script is executed.  It executes all the files ending with '*.sh'
         and the file 'sh.local' in /etc/profile.d

    3. The shell now looks for 3 files in sequence: 
         ~/.bash_profile
         ~/.Bash_login
         ~/.profile
       It runs the first one it finds and ignores the others.

    4. The ~/.bash_profile script also calls the ~/.bashrc file which is also executed,
         then it returns control to ~/.bash_profile

    5. When ~/.bash_profile finishes execution, the shell config is complete.



- Exploring the Global Configuration Scripts

    # Look at the /etc/profile script
    $ cat /etc/program

    # List startup program files
    $ ll /etc/profile.d/*.sh



- Exploring the Local Configuration Scripts

    # Look at local config scripts
    $ cat .bash_profile
    $ cat .bashrc



- Testing It

    - A good troubleshooting strategy to figure out the order in which things occur is to
        just add an 'echo' statement to each one to see the order.

        1. Edit /etc/profile

             # /etc/profile
             echo "Running /etc/profile"

        2. Edit /etc.bashrc

             # /etc.bashrc
             echo "Running /etc.bashrc"

        3. Create a new script /etc/profile.d/myBashConfig.sh

             # /etc/profile.d/myBashConfig.sh
             echo "Running /etc/profile.d/myBashConfig.sh"

        4. Edit ~/.bash_profile

             # ~/.bash_profile
             echo "Running ~/.bash_profile"

        5. Edit ~/.bashrc

             # ~/.bashrc
             echo "Running ~/.bashrc" 


    - When we start a non-login shell (open a terminal):

        Running ~/.bashrc
        Running /etc/bashrc
        Running /etc/profile.d/myBashConfig.sh


    - When we start a login shell (switch to virtual console 2 and login):

        Running /etc/profile
        Running /etc/profile.d/myBashConfig.sh
        Running /etc/bashrc
        Running ~/.bash_profile
        Running ~/.bashrc
        Running /etc/bashrc
