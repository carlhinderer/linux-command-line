CHAPTER 7 - SEEING THE WORLD AS THE SHELL SEES IT
----------------------------------------------------

- Expansion

    - Each time we type a command and press the 'Enter' key, bash performs several substitutions upon
        the text before it carries out our command.  This process is called 'expansion'.


    - To demonstrate how this works, we look at the 'echo' command.  'echo' is a shell built-in that 
        just prints its text arguments on stdout.


      # Print 'this is a test'
      $ echo this is a test


      # Print the files in the directory
      $ echo *


      The shell expands the '*' into the list of files in the directory before the 'echo' command is
        executed.



- Pathname Expansion

    - The mechanism by which wildcards work is called 'pathname expansion'.  


      $ ls
      Desktop    ls-output.txt  Pictures  Templates
      Documents  Music          Public    Videos


      $ echo D*
      Desktop Documents


      $ echo *s
      Documents Pictures Templates Videos


      $ echo [[:upper:]]*
      Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates Videos


      $ echo /usr/*/share
      /usr/kerberos/share /usr/local/share



- Tilde Expansion

    - When the tilde character is used as the beginning of a word, it expands into the name of the
        home directory of the named user (or the home directory of the current user is no user is
        specified).


      # Home directory of current user
      $ echo ~
      /home/me


      # Home directory of another user
      $ echo ~foo
      /home/foo
