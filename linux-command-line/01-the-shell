CHAPTER 1 - THE SHELL
-------------------------------------------------

- Shells and Terminals

    - The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating 
        system to carry out. 

    - Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called
        bash. The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact
        bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
        Steve Bourne.

    - When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need another program called a terminal
        emulator to interact with the shell. GNOME uses gnome-terminal.



- Normally, we'll see a $ at the prompt when we log in.  If we see a #, it means we logged in
    as root and have superuser privileges.



- Simple Commands

    # Get the current date and time
    $ date

    # Get the calendar for the current month
    $ cal

    # Free Disk Space
    $ df

    # Free Memory
    $ free



- Virtual Terminals

    - Even if we have no terminal emulator running, several terminal sessions continue
        to run behind the graphical desktop. 

    - We can access these sessions, called virtual terminals or virtual consoles, by 
        pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F6 on most Linux distributions. When a 
        session is accessed, it presents a login prompt into which we can enter our 
        username and password. 

    - To switch from one virtual console to another, press Alt-F1 through Alt-F6. On 
        most system we can return to the graphical desktop by pressing Alt-F7.
